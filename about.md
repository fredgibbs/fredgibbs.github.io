# Hello World!
I'm Fred Gibbs, an associate professor in the [history department](http://history.unm.edu) at the [University of New Mexico](http://unm.edu).

My primary interest is in working with community partners to build a shared digital heritage infrastructure and create a new kind of historical record of cultural heritage. I also enjoy reading and writing about various aspects in the history of food---most recently the history and rhetoric of natural food.

For over a decade I have worked and published in various facets of the digital humanities, including computational history, digital editing and publishing, and data visualization. As an author and editor I have published a wide-ranging curriculum for helping scholars of all ranks blend qualitative and quantitative analytical skills. For nearly two decades I have embraced my love/hate relationship with web publishing technologies, especially web design and development with HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP, and Python.

I've served (since Oct 2016) as an editor of the [H-Nutrition](https://networks.h-net.org/h-nutrition) network on H-Net. I co-founded and co-organized the UNM [Spatial Humanities Working Group](http://spatialhumanities.unm.edu) (2015-18). Previously (2012-2017), I served as a general editor at [Programming Historian](http://programminghistorian.org).

More on these projects, as well as past efforts can be found on [my project page](projects). A list of publications (and links to them) is on [my CV](cv).

My earlier research focused on premodern toxicology, particularly late medieval and early modern medical literature on poison. I wrote a really boring [book](https://www.routledge.com/Poison-Medicine-and-Disease-in-Late-Medieval-and-Early-Modern-Europe/Gibbs/p/book/9781472420398) about it. But it's really useful if you're into that sort of thing.

When I'm not experimenting with new digital essay formats, I like trying to grow food, start (and occasionally finish) DIY remodeling projects, and make awkward [posters](/posters).


# History
Until the spring of 2013, I was an assistant professor in the department of History and Art History at [George Mason University](http:///gmu.edu) (Fairfax, VA) and director of digital scholarship at the [Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media](http://chnm.gmu.edu).

I completed my History of Science PhD at the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](http://wisc.edu), where I discovered a new interest in web design and development. For a few years before that, I did menial cubicle chores \[= web programming] (where I also built elaborate soda-can towers) after studying physics at [Carleton College](http://www.carleton.edu). I grew up in Prior Lake, MN, where I enjoyed riding bikes through neighbors' yards, playing  mindless video games (experiments in algorithms, really), and trying to get computers to do stuff.


# Behind the scenes
Pages of this site are written in Markdown, converted to static HTML with Jekyll, and hosted in a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/fredgibbs/fredgibbs.github.io) and rendered via GitHub Pages. Several, I mean many, years ago I jotted down [a few reflections on my switch from Wordpress to GitHub](posts/a-new-minimalist-versioned-website), which continue to hold true.
