# Hello World!
I'm Fred Gibbs, an associate professor in the [history department](http://history.unm.edu) at the [University of New Mexico](http://unm.edu).

My research focuses primarily on the changing historical relationships between food, diet and health (particularly the popularization of nutritional science), and the intersection of food, environmental, and urban histories (particularly food production, distribution, and geographies of health).

My work in the digital humanities (particularly digital history) explores new modes of historical research and publishing, the importance of design in scholarship (especially cartography), critical GIS, and emerging digital publication practices for scholarship.

I continue to run the UNM [Spatial Humanities Working Group](http://spatialhumanities.unm.edu) (co-founded in 2015), and serve (since Oct 2016) as an editor of the [H-Nutrition](https://networks.h-net.org/h-nutrition) network on H-Net. Previously, from 2012-2017, I served as a general editor at [Programming Historian](http://programminghistorian.org).

More on these projects, as well as other ongoing and previous research appears on [my project portfolio](../projects), and check peruse some publications (and links to them) on [my CV](../cv).

Previously, my research focused on premodern toxicology, particularly late medieval and early modern medical literature on poison. I wrote [book](https://www.routledge.com/Poison-Medicine-and-Disease-in-Late-Medieval-and-Early-Modern-Europe/Gibbs/p/book/9781472420398) about it.


# History
Until the spring of 2013, I was an assistant professor in the department of History and Art History at [George Mason University](http:///gmu.edu) (Fairfax, VA) and director of digital scholarship at the [Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media](http://chnm.gmu.edu).

I completed my History of Science PhD at the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](http://wisc.edu), where I discovered a new interest in web design and development. For a few years before that, I did menial cubicle chores \[= web programming] (where I also built elaborate soda-can towers) after studying physics at [Carleton College](http://www.carleton.edu). I grew up in Prior Lake, MN, where I enjoyed riding bikes through neighbors' yards, playing  mindless video games, and learning to get computers to do what I want.


# Behind the scenes
Pages of this site are written in Markdown and converted to static HTML with Jekyll. All code for this site is hosted in a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/fredgibbs/fredgibbs.github.io) and rendered via GitHub Pages. Several years ago I jotted down [a few reflections on my switch from Wordpress to GitHub](posts/a-new-minimalist-versioned-website), which continue to hold true.
