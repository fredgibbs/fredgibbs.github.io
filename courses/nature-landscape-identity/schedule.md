## 8: FINALS WEEK

## May 14
{% include alert.html class='danger' title='DUE: Final Course Reflection' text="
Final Essays should be submitted before you go to bed on May 14th (or perhaps early Saturday morning). If you need a few more days, that's fine, but you must email me to let me know (you don't need to ask, just let me know). Grades are due in the middle of the week so there isn't much more leeway I can give you, unless you want to take an Incomplete.

See the [final essay guide](final-essay-guide) for more details. And review the [revision guide](writing-advice) after you've got a solid first draft!
