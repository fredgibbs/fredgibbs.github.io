### The DH Phenomenon
What *is* digital humanities? How does studying "the digital" vs. using "the digital" factor into definitions? Is it necessary to have a working definition?

### Core Principles of DH
What are the central concerns of the so-called digital humanities community? Does it make sense to talk about Digital Humanities as opposed to Digital History or Digital Literature? Why is there no Digital Philosophy?

### The New Publishing

You shouldn't be ignorant of how the internet works---the largest and most accessible publishing platform ever---if your job invovles knowledge production and dissemination anymore than you should be ignorant of literacy. If you think your work is valuable, you should know something about the methods at your disposal to communicate it to a wide audience in the form you think is most appropriate.

#### ABQ Airport + History

**Meet in Zimmerman Library, Frank Waters Room for Library presentation on ABQ Airport sources**    
To get to the Frank Waters Room, do a U-turn to the left after coming through the main entrance of the library, through the double doors (heading toward the Center for Southwest Research), and you'll see through the glass wall a seminar room, and probably me, on your left.

After the presentation, we'll stay in that room and do a bit more initial planning about what our ABQ Airport project will look like, first exploring some existing efforts (which you should consult before class; use experience of our previous critiques and discussion):

### Thinking About Data
With a few notable exceptions, historians typically don't consider their sources as data. But why is that? What is data? Are there any advantages to shifting the way we conceptualize our sources? What might we gain, or lose, by thinking about the historical record as data?

### Scripting Basics
It's easy to find data, but often hard to find data in the exact form / format you need. A few basic programming skills can go a LONG way, and sometimes is the only way. Untether yourself from tools that other people make for you.

<div class="left_box">
#### Unleashing your computer
Come to class having gone as far as possible with the [Python tutorials](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/python) and we'll answer questions and write a program together to normalize data.
</div>

<div class="right_box">
#### Fall Break: No Class!
Relax a bit, but start early on your scripts to parse your data into a format that you can use with Bookworm or Overview or Voyant. This is going to take way longer than you think. We'll do more troubleshooting next week.
