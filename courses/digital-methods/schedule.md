### The DH Phenomenon
What *is* digital humanities? How does studying "the digital" vs. using "the digital" factor into definitions? Is it necessary to have a working definition?

### Core Principles of DH
What are the central concerns of the so-called digital humanities community? Does it make sense to talk about Digital Humanities as opposed to Digital History or Digital Literature? Why is there no Digital Philosophy?

#### DH Projects Review
We'll delve into some of the debates about the nature of "DH" and also begin exploring some [DH projects](http://dhcommons.org/projects) (whether focused on presenting archives, interpretation, methodology, exhibits, etc) to get a better feel for the digital footprint of DH.

### The New Publishing

<div class="left_box">
#### Interfacing History
You shouldn't be ignorant of how the internet works---the largest and most accessible publishing platform ever---if your job invovles knowledge production and dissemination anymore than you should be ignorant of literacy. If you think your work is valuable, you should know something about the methods at your disposal to communicate it to a wide audience in the form you think is most appropriate.

**Homework to be done by today:**     
1) Install [MAMP](http://www.mamp.info/en/downloads/) (Mac) or [WAMP](http://www.wampserver.com/en/) (Windows) so you can make webpages on your own computer.

2) Make a simple webpage, after reading through an [Introduction to HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Introduction) and an [Introduction to XML and HTML](http://www.w3schools.com/xml/xml_whatis.asp)

#### ABQ Airport + History

**Meet in Zimmerman Library, Frank Waters Room for Library presentation on ABQ Airport sources**    
To get to the Frank Waters Room, do a U-turn to the left after coming through the main entrance of the library, through the double doors (heading toward the Center for Southwest Research), and you'll see through the glass wall a seminar room, and probably me, on your left.

After the presentation, we'll stay in that room and do a bit more initial planning about what our ABQ Airport project will look like, first exploring some existing efforts (which you should consult before class; use experience of our previous critiques and discussion):

[Historic Albuquerque](http://www.downtownacd.org/historic-downtown/)

### Spatial History + GIS

<div class="left_box">
#### Spatial History

Richard White    
[What is spatial history](http://www.stanford.edu/group/spatialhistory/cgi-bin/site/pub.php?id=29)?

Ian Gregory and David Cooper    
[GIS, Texts, and Images: New Approaches](http://journals.tdl.org/paj/index.php/paj/article/view/20).

Prepare critiques of some [DH GIS Projects](http://anterotesis.com/wordpress/dh-gis-projects/)

Read "Introducing GIS" and "Vector Data" from this [gentle introduction to GIS](http://docs.qgis.org/2.2/en/docs/gentle_gis_introduction/index.html).

Download and install [QGIS](http://www.qgis.org/en/site/). Your job is just to get the application running on your computer. Note: if you have a Mac, you have to install 2 required packages before installing QGIS; follow the instructions carefully (kyngchaos is your friend)! We'll troubleshoot any installation issues and go over the interface and other basic GIS concepts in class.

</div>

<div class="right_box">
#### Mapping with QGIS

Return to the [gentle introduction to GIS](http://docs.qgis.org/2.2/en/docs/gentle_gis_introduction/index.html), reading up through "Coordinate Reference Systems".

Load some ABQ data layers with QGIS, using shapefiles (or CSV or KML files) from one of the below sources:    
[ABQ GIS Data](http://www.cabq.gov/gis/geographic-information-systems-data)  
[ABQ Open Data](http://www.cabq.gov/abq-data)  
[UNM GIS Data Clearinghouse](http://rgis.unm.edu/)  

See if you can create some interesting, even if useless, maps by overlaying totally different data sets.

If you get stuck or have questions, consult the [QGIS Training Manual](http://docs.qgis.org/2.2/en/docs/training_manual/), [the QGIS wiki](http://hub.qgis.org/projects/quantum-gis/wiki/How_do_I_do_that_in_QGIS), and an [array of tutorials](http://qgistutorials.com).

[What is a Mountain? Or The Englishman who went up a Boolean Geographical Concept but Realised it was Fuzzy](http://www.jstor.org/stable/pdfplus/40573211.pdf?acceptTC=true).    

Jason Farman, “Mapping the Digital Empire: Google Earth and the Process of Postmodern Cartography,” New Media & Society 12, no. 6 (2010): 869–88.

Experience the lite-ness of [Google Maps Engine Lite](http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/googlemaps-googleearth), but use the ABQ [public art data](http://www.cabq.gov/culturalservices/public-art/documents/ABQPublicArtMap.csv/at_download/file), and play around with the map styling as the tutorial suggests.

Understand the [basics of KML](https://developers.google.com/kml/documentation/kml_tut).      

</div>

<div class="right_box">
#### Local Maps

Add a simple Google map [using these instructions](https://developers.google.com/maps/tutorials/fundamentals/adding-a-google-map). Do not proceed to the next step until this is working!

Make it fancier [with these instructions](https://developers.google.com/maps/tutorials/kml/). There is lots of technical jargon here that will confuse you--it's going to extend your javascript skills--and that's why we'll talk it over in class. But you should have already worked through the tutorial so you have questions about what's going on.

See if you can display a KML file from [ABQ Open Data](http://www.cabq.gov/abq-data)

### Thinking About Data
With a few notable exceptions, historians typically don't consider their sources as data. But why is that? What is data? Are there any advantages to shifting the way we conceptualize our sources? What might we gain, or lose, by thinking about the historical record as data?

### Scripting Basics
It's easy to find data, but often hard to find data in the exact form / format you need. A few basic programming skills can go a LONG way, and sometimes is the only way. Untether yourself from tools that other people make for you.

<div class="left_box">
#### Unleashing your computer
Come to class having gone as far as possible with the [Python tutorials](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/python) and we'll answer questions and write a program together to normalize data.
</div>

<div class="right_box">
#### Fall Break: No Class!
Relax a bit, but start early on your scripts to parse your data into a format that you can use with Bookworm or Overview or Voyant. This is going to take way longer than you think. We'll do more troubleshooting next week.
