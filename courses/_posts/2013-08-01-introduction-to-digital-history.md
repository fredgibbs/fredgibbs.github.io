### Course Description
This course explores the theoretical and methodological issues now facing humanistic study in a digital age. It presents a broad survey of how powerful new research methodologies now allow historians (broadly construed, including literary historians) to ask and answer fundamentally different kinds of questions. It explores topics such as data visualization, geo-spatial analysis, and text mining. On the whole, it aims to provide conceptual fluency on topics such as the uses of new media to present scholarly research, the implications of copyright law on access to historical data and scholarship, the changing role of museums and libraries, and the politics of authority and expertise in knowledge networks. The course also reflects on the changing nature of the humanities (such as their possible convergence toward the social sciences). This course challenges the typical conceptions of how one ought to produce and consume history as well as provides guidelines for effectively bridging and combining humanities and technology skills that will *make you more employable*.


### Course Goals
- Understand the theories and principles of new media and technology and their potential impact on the humanities, with an emphasis on history

- Develop conversational fluency: understand current debates and speak intelligently with both skeptics and advocates about the history and future of digital scholarship and its relationship to the world.

- Appreciate the theoretical possibilities and practical limitations of digital archives, new research methodologies, and modes of scholarly communication.

- Begin to experiment with new tools, workflows, and ways of thinking about history.


### Course Expectations and Grading
- Thorough preparedness and engaged participation in every class meeting. See the note about readings and discussion below. (30%)

- Create and use your own blog and Twitter account for the course. (5%)

- Original 400-word critical reaction blog posts posted to your own blog before each class. I will supply a brief prompt for these to help focus your posts on key issues. These should NOT merely summarize the readings, but critically evaluate them and ask questions that will guide our discussion. You need to do 7 of these throughout the semester. (30%)

- Lead one discussion by having good questions prepared ahead of time to help call attention to interesting points in the readings, connect them to each other, and connect that day's readings to previous readings and discussions. (5%)

- Completion of a Final Project in the guise of a preparing necessary materials for (but not actually submitting) a Kickstarter campaign.  (25%)

- Perseverance and tolerance for frustration with hypothetical discussions. Digital humanities engages with new methodological problems and professional challenges raised by rapidly shifting technology and new media. Must be able to have fun while groping. (5%)


### Other Advice to Help You Do Well
-   Do not suffer in silence. I try to situate discussions and assignments squarely within the objectives of the course, but I expect that you'll ask for clarification if such connections elude you.

-   If you have questions about your performance/grade during the semester, I will be very happy to meet with you to discuss how things are going. I understand that everyone comes into the course with different skills and backgrounds. **Serious effort goes a long way toward your grade!**

-   Our reading list only scratches the surface of the topics that inevitably arise during discussion. I expect that you will help steer the discussions around your particular interests. In fact, that you retain such control is central to the success of the course. This is a polite way of saying that you share some responsibility in making this class relevant to your future career(s). Of course I'll do my best to make sure that it is, but I need your help.


### Final Project / Grant Proposal
The goals of the final project are (1) to show that you have grasped the topics presented in the course, and (2) to express them in a non-traditional form.

You will design a Kickstarter campaign ([following their guidelines](http://www.kickstarter.com/help/school)) for a digital history project relevant to your field. It doesn't have to overlap perfectly with your current research, but it shouldn't be so far afield that you don't have enough subject matter expertise to propose an interesting project. Your proposal should employ technologies, methodologies, and approaches that we've decided constitute digital history. 

In addition to the Kickstarter materials, each proposal must explain its historical relevance, use of technology, limitations of methodology, expected research outcomes and benefits, sustainability plan. As with any campaign, one great challenge is to explain in lay terms why your project is interesting, how people will benefit from it, and why people should get excited enough to support it. 


### READINGS
Most readings are either hyperlinked to an online version, or are available via the course Zotero library. There are 5 required books. Some of these are available online for free, but we're reading through each of the books in their entirety (so that's a *lot* of screen time).

_Important note about reading and discussion:_ During each class, articles for the next class will be assigned to a person who will act as the "primary reader" (PR) for that article (sometimes this will be me; generally we'll just take volunteers). The PR will provide a ~5 minute synopsis of the point or argument of the piece, and a ~5 minute contextualization of that article within other course readings. Throughout discussion, they will serve as the expert for that piece and bring it into the conversation whenever relevant. Everyone is expected to read all the assignments, even if not the primary reader. Take special care if you are.


### 1. Introduction to the Course and Digital History
What *is* digital humanities? Digital history? How does studying "the digital" vs. using "the digital" factor into definitions? Is it necessary to have a working definition? What about digital history? We'll delve into some of the debates about the nature of "DH" and also begin exploring some (online) projects (whether focused on presenting archives, interpretation, methodology, exhibits, etc) to get a better feel for the field.

### 2. New Scholarly Spaces: Blogs, Tweets, and Digital Identities
Is the digitally networked academic sphere networked differently than it has been? As part of our discussion, you'll set up individual blogs for the course, populate your RSS feed, establish Twitter accounts, make sure you're connected to the course Zotero Library.

### 3. Core Principles of the Digital Humanities
What are the central concerns of the so-called digital humanities community? Does it make sense to talk about Digital Humanities as opposed to Digital History or Digital Literature? Why is there no Digital Philosophy? 

Anne Burdick et al., *Digital\_Humanities*.


### 4. (Re)presenting History
Why has narrative been so central to the history profession? What are the advantages and disadvantages? Is narrative still the best way of describing or "doing" history in the 21st century?

Scott McCloud, *Understanding Comics*.

### 5. The Nature of Historical Data
What are the pros and cons of thinking of the historical record as data? What are the perils and promises of visualizing it? We'll also get some practice mucking around with a few tools designed to make this easier and relatively non-technical.

### 10. Data, Digital Workflows, Digital Studies
There are great digital datasets available, but most historians work with sources that are far from ready to be plugged into digital tools. This group of readings suggests some techniques and strategies to make traditional analog sources suitable for use in a digital workflow. Everyone has to choose the set of tools and workflow that's appropriate to their own needs and habits. But having an open mind and flexibility in adjusting your own work habits can go a long way towards lowering the impedance between you and digital tools that can help your productivity skyrocket, and in fact allow you to venture into unchartered historical waters.

Rachel Leow, [DevonThink](http://idlethink.wordpress.com/category/devonthink/). (Read this article AND at least skim through the short three part series that it links to.)

Rather than assign more specific readings to cover the pedagogy facet we talked about the first day, we'll each find a reading related to how we might better integrate the kinds of concerns that underlie this course into undergraduate humanities courses generally.


### 11. Code
One particularly vibrant conversation of the past few years in the digital humanities community concerns whether digital humanists should learn to code. Although often answered with a yes or no, the more helpful question is the extent to which (and the conditions under which) coding knowledge and experience is either useful and/or necessary in the digital humanities. Should it be required learning in digital humanities courses? Regular humanities courses?

### 13. Crowdsourcing
Is scholarly collaboration any different than it has been? Does Wikipedia mean the death of the author?

### 14. Critiquing Digital History
What are the fundamental criteria for critiquing digital history projects? How much does the traditional peer review model need to change to accommodate new types of historical work/projects?

### 15. Copyright & Access
What's at stake for historians (even when not using images)? How is this relevant to historical texts? Or datasets that have been curated and published? What obligation do historians have to make the past more accessible in forms other than books and articles?
