# Video Critique Shore Sheet
The are two main components to your video review, as outlined below: the review and video component

## Review Component
Same review goals as the [critique writing guide](markdown-critiques) you used before (see the GOALS section at the bottom). The main difference, obviously, is that you are using the video to evaluate and critique the functionality of the site---which would be totally inefficient to describe in words.

### FOR YOUR CONVENIENCE THEY ARE COPIED BELOW
- Explain what KIND of site it is (archive interface, map exploration, educational, etc)
- Make it clear what the goals of the project are
- Provide some summary of the main features / functionality
- Note stated or apparent intended audience
- Evaluate how well the various facets of the website facilitate those goals (design, organization, writing style, interface, functionality)
- Explain where data comes from
- Make a note of aspects that fail badly
- Make a note of aspects that work well
- **Remember to draw from our readings from earlier in the semester (_yes in fact there was a reason we read all those_)**
  - In particular, think about how maps, databases, interfaces, shape the kinds of interpretations the website is meant to facilitate.
  - Give one or two specific examples to illustrate your points

## SUPER IMPORTANT HINT 1
There are always decisions to be made about whether to simply describe features of the website, then critique them later in the video, OR to describe and critique as you go. Depending on how you're doing your video, both _can_ be effective. But if you are unsure, **I highly recommend integrating your description and critique because it means less repetition and usually less editing.**

## SUPER IMPORTANT HINT 2
Most of the work of these videos is figuring out what you want to do, then getting a clean video/audio for it. Usually this means recording a bunch of stuff that you'll decide later is crap because you've developed better ideas for what to say and how to say/show it. This iterative process is essential for a good video when you're learning how to do them.


## Video component

### Audio
- Efficient script (no long pauses, rambling, mumbling, umming, etc)
- Aim for a "natural" rhythm in your narration
- The best videos use EVERY WORD carefully
- No screen narration (saying what you are obviously doing in the video)
- No wild volume discrepancies between takes
- Be careful of throwaway phrases (Now let's look at X; So if we click on the About tab; etc)


### Video
- Clear purpose to what you're recording
- Mostly seamless editing between takes (inc transitions)
- Very limited time without action (no talking over a still screen)
- No waiting for pages to load or other delays
- No flailing cursors (use effects or nothing)
- No unnecessary scrolling


### General
- Video should be accessible to a general audience
- Explain what the user can learn about history generally
- The visual and audio tracks complement rather than duplicate each other
- Efficiency! Make sure your videos don't stall
- Energy! Keep viewers engaged
