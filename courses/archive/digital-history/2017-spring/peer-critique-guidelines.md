# Peer Critique Guidelines
As you begin reading the essay that you will critique, keep foremost in your mind that the main goal is to help improve the essay. You must resist the temptation to avoid actual criticism in order not to hurt the author's feelings. Be critical, fair, and courteous. As these critiques are an official course assignment, you’re being evaluated on your sincere engagement with your partner's essay. Avoid entirely subjective complaints ("I don't like how you phrased this"). This does not help anyone do anything. Instead, make a more concrete criticism that can be acted upon: ("Here it was difficult to follow the writing; I wasn’t sure what the point of this paragraph was.").

## Critique Process
You will add comments to the original critique by inserting comments in double square brackets [[like this]] to make them stand out from the original text. In addition, please provide 5-10 bullet point comments at the end of the critique that provide a few synthetic comments about the essay as a whole.

## What to comment on
Below are a list of questions you should be asking yourself and comment on in your critiques.
Does the essay ...

### Content (spatial histories)
- describe how it originally fit into surroundings?
- describe how it and the space around it changed over time?
- describe how it fits into current surroundings?

### Analysis (sophistication)
- analyze how it could be useful in terms of cultural memory?
- suggest missed opportunities? (these essays are a kind of critique after all)
- engagement with course readings?
- use and discuss appropriate images?

### Style (energetic)
- have a general flow to it?
- avoid choppy, simplistic sentences?
- provide an engaging first paragraph, and first sentences of other paragraphs?
- keep the readers attention?
- motivate the reader to appreciate the significance of the essay's subject?

## Form (skimmable)
- use appropriate headers?
- consistently use a reasonable paragraph length for online reading?
- (we'll tackle design later)
