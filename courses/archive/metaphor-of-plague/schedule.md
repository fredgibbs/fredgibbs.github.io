# Communicating Plague
20: ESSAY #3 DUE: **How does this course help you better analyze writing about disease?** Remember to 1) BE SPECIFIC; 2) Reference as many readings as possible with specific citations; 3) Hopefully you can't fit everything you've learned into two pages (but that's the limit); choose carefully what you think is most important! 4) Don't be banal---so don't say: "Metaphors shape the way we think of disease." That's too obvious. Give examples of how/when/where this has been true, and how it still matters (or doesn't).
