## Assignment Guidelines

- Your job is to provide a two-page answer/analysis of the question(s) posed on the syllabus.

- 2 pages maximum. I will discard any additional pages, and I will grade you more hashly for making me do so.

- Use bullet points to develop a coherent answer to the question. However, do not use highly elliptical sentences or sentence fragments that are hard to follow. You must strive for both concision and clarity. This is _really_ difficult. 

- Be sure you have a logical structure and progression to your bullet points. A random collection of ideas will be frowned upon.

- Make sure every single idea works directly toward answering the question and fits into your overall argument/structure.

- Never, even mention only that something relates to something else. You must explain how and why and the significance of the relationship. 

- You must use specific examples from the readings. The more the better, but more citatations do not necessarily equate to a better essay. Citations for irrelevant points only detract from the overall effectiveness of your essay.

- There is no right answer to the question, but that doesn't mean you can argue anything at all.

- The design of your document is an integral part of the assginment, notsuperficial window dressing. 

- Use clear and consistent formatting that makes your document highly readable.
	- no tiny margins
	- no tiny fonts
	- consistent indentation and spacing
	- avoid compressed spacing between lines and bullet points
	- avoid huge gaps between lines or bullets that waste space
	- use bold typeface to highlight your most important ideas; use regular typeface for additional explanation if you supply it; use italics to highlight important words or phrases.
