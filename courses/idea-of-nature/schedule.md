# Schedule of Readings and Assignments

{% include alert.html class='info' title='Reflections' text="
For each group of readings (by day), submit via email a ~350-word reflection on the readings.  Please DO NOT SUMMARIZE the readings one by one. I'm looking for how you can compare and contrast them, and relate them to previous course material. You should answer the same questions for each group of readings and give specific examples:
- Where did you see the most overlap between the readings? In other words, what are the major themes they have in common?
- Where did the readings differ in significant ways in terms of disagreement or simply different perspectives?
- How did the set of readings offer a different way of thinking about nature compared to previous readings?
- If applicable: How do the primary sources illustrate what's being discussed by the secondary sources?

## Week 8: FINALLY

## May 14
{% include alert.html class='danger' title='DUE: Final Course Reflection' text="
Final Essays should be submitted before you go to bed on May 14th (or perhaps early Saturday morning). If you need a few more days, that's fine, but you must email me to let me know (you don't need to ask, just let me know). Grades are due in the middle of the week so there isn't much more leeway I can give you, unless you want to take an Incomplete.

See the [final essay guide](final-essay-guide) for more details. And review the [revision guide](writing-advice) after you've got a solid first draft!
