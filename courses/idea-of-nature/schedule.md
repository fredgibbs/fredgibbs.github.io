# Schedule of Readings and Assignments


## Week 1

### 10/17: Intro
We'll review the course aims, assignments, and general plan for our 1/2 semester together.
- What is your definition of "nature"?
- Why do conceptions of "nature" matter?
  - To better answer that question, read Gavin Lamb, [Nature: The Most Complex Word in the English Language](https://medium.com/curious/nature-the-most-complex-word-in-the-english-language-8992b983f0e3)
  - For the original "Nature" entry, see Williams, _Keywords_ in the Zotero library.



### 10/19: Considering Nature at Scale
- D. W. Meinig, "The Beholding Eye: Ten Versions of the Same Scene" (1979), 33--48.
- Raymond Williams, _Keywords_ (Introduction). This nicely explains why words like "nature" are so revealing. We need to keep this in mind throughout the course.
- CHALLENGE: Raymond Williams, "Ideas of Nature" (1980), 67--85. This reading is a challenge at times! But the many excellent ideas about different ways to think about nature--and how it's changed over time--make it worth the effort. Be prepared to describe the ideas that you were able to get out of it and our discussion should clarify the rest.
- SKIM CAREFULLY: Leo Marx, "The Idea of Nature in America", in Zotero as a PDF and [online](https://www.amacad.org/publication/idea-nature-america) (2008), 8--21. This reading provides an overview of many themes and ideas we'll explore throughout the course. It will be very useful for you to be familiar with it, but we'll do our own overview in class.

#### Noteworthy
- Frédéric Ducarme and Denis Couvet, “What Does ‘Nature’ Mean?” (2020), 1–8.
- John Hay, "The Nature Writer's Dilemma" (1987), 7--10.


{% include alert.html class='danger' title='First Reading Reflections Due TODAY (10/19)' text="
Please remember that you have a reading reflection due each day we have class. The instructions are on the [home page](index) of the syllabus that we discussed on Monday. Just to be clear: your reflections should be about the readings for TODAY (10/19). One of the main goals of the reflections is to help you prepare for class discussion. Remember, just one piece of paper, but double-sided printing is fine. They should be at least 300 words (which is a little less than a page), but showing more engagement gets you more points!

## Week 2

- Ralph Waldo Emerson, "Nature" (1836), 7--24 (SKIM through p. 53). These are really small pages, so it's not as much reading as it seems. The idea is to get a sense of how Emerson thinks about nature, not read in great detail.

Our key question here is how much should we be worried about the end of nature if we can construct it? Or is that simply impossible by the very definition of natural?
- Discussion: Colonization on Mars has just begun after finding a giant layer of ice buried beneath the surface. You have been appointed the Director of Nature, and you need to provide a vision statement for how to create nature on Mars. How do you want people to think about nature when the duality between natural nature and manufactured nature is so stark?


### 11/23: NO CLASS: EAT WELL!



## Week 7
### 11/28: Consuming Nature
- James Morton Turner, "From Woodcraft to  'Leave No Trace'", 137--169.

#### Noteworthy
- Phoebe S. K. Young, _Camping Grounds_ [Ch. 5: The Back-to-Nature Crowd], 195--240.



### 11/30: Applying Nature: Natural Stuff
A main goal of this class is to make it easier to think of how the idea of nature permeates so many things we interact with. Like childbirth. Like food. So how we can we apply definitions of nature (in general) as we've seen it change over time to something more specific like food (like we see in so many contexts now)?

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='DUE: Final Course Reflection' text="
Final Essays should be submitted before you go to bed on December 14th (or perhaps early Saturday morning). If you need a few more days, that's fine, but you must email me to let me know (you don't need to ask, just let me know). Grades are due in the middle of the week so there isn't much more leeway I can give you, unless you want to take an Incomplete (which is fine if you have a specific plan for completing the work quickly).

See the [final essay guide](final-reflection-guide) for more details. And review the [revision guide](writing-advice) after you've got a solid first draft!
