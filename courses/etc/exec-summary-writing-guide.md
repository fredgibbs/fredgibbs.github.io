# Executive Summary Writing Guide

## Assignment Purpose
These kinds of assignments show that you're doing the reading and thinking about how to relate them to the other readings and our discussions. Obviously you can do this in our class meetings as well, but this gives you yet another forum to show that you're learning. And to help me give you the most appropriate grade at the end of the term.


## Your Job
In terms of the writing itself, the assignments encourage/force you to focus on the clarity and concision of your thinking and expression. It's a super useful skill that you'll frequently employ in your future career, whatever it is. 


## Assignment Format
- You must use only bullet points (and sub-bullets) to articulate your ideas.
- One page maximum.  
- Use complete sentences. You must strive for both concision and clarity. This is _really_ difficult.
- Make interesting and sophisticated observations in each bullet point.
- Be sure you create and follow a logical structure and progression to your bullet points. A random collection of ideas will be frowned upon.


## General formatting checklist
- 11 pt. Times New Roman (or very similar serif font)
- 1" margins on all sides
- Your name on top; do not bother noting the course, me, etc.
- Everything should be single spaced, but put a blank line between bullet points.

## Tips for success
 - **Be specific.** Something like, "Railroads were important to Chicago's development" tells me little more than you have a pulse. Don't waste our time, please.
 - **Provide specific citations.** This forces you to double check your own memory and interpretation of the readings, and helps you avoid making false claims. In your references to the reading, use page numbers.
 - **Paraphase.** Avoid full quotations in your critique (short phrases are fine), since you want use all the space for your own thinking.
 - **Be selective.** You canâ€™t fit everything worth saying into your essay. Choose carefully what you think is most important!
 - **Revise, revise, revise.** Once you have a complete draft of everything you want to say, you are about 50% done. Set it aside (and budget time for this!), then come back and economize your prose. Remove simple sentences that force you to be unnecessarily verbose.

 1 (initial idea): There was a cat. The cat was black and it chased a mouse, which was eating cheese.    
 2 (revised prose): The black cat chased the cheese-eating mouse.  

**Revisions are hard!** But they are the only way to make your writing shine.


## Questions
It is always worthwhile to talk about these things in class; don't hesitate to ask. Email is OK, too, especially for quick questions.
