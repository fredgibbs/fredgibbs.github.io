# Critique Writing Guide

## Your Assignment
Your challenge is to write a review/critique of some “publication” pertaining to this course---namely the relationship between food, health, and diet. It can be an article or blog post from a website, newspaper, or magazine; it can be a video, movie, or food documentary; science research article, historical scholarship, or whatever you like. Feel free to find these via Google, UNM Library databases, or whatever (you’ll have more fun with Google).

Don't choose something that is super long or complex; that creates way more work for you than is necessary here. Also, don't choose anything that is super short and trite; it simply won't give you enough material to work with.


## Assignment Goals
This assignment shows that you’re able to apply the course discussion and activities in the real world by critically analyzing some source that you might read even outside of this course. **This is the goal of the entire course---see the learning objectives on the syllabus!---to help you think carefully and historically about diet and health.** In terms of the writing itself, the assignments encourage/force you to focus on the clarity and concision of your thinking and expression. It's a super useful skill that you'll frequently employ in your future career, whatever it is.


## Assignment Format

### First Essay
Your essay must be 400-500 words. This restrictive format is very deliberate, to force you to think about quality over quantity. The challenge isn't to write 500 words, but pack as much analysis into that space as you can, and to make your writing as concise as possible.

### Second Essay
This time, your format challenge is to produce a 1-2 page bullet point critique.

- It has the same purpose and goals as the first 500-word essay, but you must use only bullet points (and sub-bullets) to articulate your ideas.
- The emphasis here should be on foregrounding your excellent ideas rather than on writing an essay.
- Do not use highly elliptical sentences or sentence fragments that are hard to follow. You must strive for both concision and clarity. This is _really_ difficult.
- Make interesting and sophisticated observations in each bullet point.
- Be sure you create and follow a logical structure and progression to your bullet points. A random collection of ideas will be frowned upon.



## Some organizational advice (regardless of format)
You should begin your essay with a **quick summary** of the source---no more than a few sentences---so that your readers have an idea of what the point is (assume they have not read it themselves).

Then, comment about the evidence used to make the point. Maybe there are "scientific" studies, maybe anecdotal evidence, maybe nothing. Relatedly, how does the author establish expertise or authority?

Are you convinced by the evidence? What is problematic or missing? What are the assumptions of the author about the nature of diet and health?

**Can the history of diet and health (as we've discussed it so far), provide any insight into what the article is talking about?** For instance, you might discuss (thinking about the early part of the course in particular) _how your source balances common sense and medical advice_.



## References and Citations
You should cite passages from the readings with author-date notation.

An example: _Although Cheyne appealed to his personal experience with diet, he himself was extraordinarily large (Shapin, "Trusting," 276)._ Note that I've used a abbreviated form of the article name since we read two things by Shapin. You can omit that if there is only one source by the author, like (Cowan, 15).

If you cite something from outside the class, you need to provide a foot- or endnote with a full reference to that source (either a URL or regular bibliographic citation). You can use any format you want, but be consistent.


## General formatting checklist

- 12 pt. Times New Roman (or very similar serif font)
- 1" margins on all sides
- Your name and URL or citation to source at top
- For prose reports: double spaced (except name and source reference)
- For bullet reports: line spacing within the bullets should be 1.5; line spacing between bullets should be 2 (a full blank line). Avoid huge indentations or gaps between lines or bullets that waste space!


## Tips for success
 - **Be specific.** Never, even mention only that something relates to something else. You must explain how and why and the significance of the relationship. This is probably the biggest weakness with most essays. Don't say "This advice is like what Galen said." Give more details about how (and how much) such a claim is true, cite relevant passages from Galen (and/or readings about him), and why your comparison matters.
 - **Provide specific citations.** This forces you to double check your own memory and interpretation of the readings, and helps you avoid making false claims.
 - **Don't be banal.** Avoid trivial statements that are simply fluff and don't show you engaging with the course materials or your source.
 - **Paraphase.** Avoid long quotations in your critique, since you want use all the space for your own thinking!
 - **Be selective.** You can’t fit everything worth saying into your essay. Choose carefully what you think is most important!
 - **Revise, revise, revise.** Once you have a complete draft of everything you want to say, you are about 50% done. Set it aside (and budget time for this!), then come back and economize your prose. Remove simple sentences that force you to be unnecessarily verbose.

 In the process of getting your ideas on paper, you might end up with something like: "This article does not cite any research. The lack of research means it is difficult to understand if it should be trusted." (22 words)

 During revisions, you should rephrase this to: "The article's lack of research compromises its authority." (8 words) This gives you much-needed space for more analysis!

**Note: Revisions are hard!** But they are the only way to make your writing shine.


## Resubmissions
If you are not pleased with your grade, you can revise and resubmit them within **2 weeks** of getting them back. You get an average grade between the two, though I tend to count the second one a bit more. I encourage you to meet with me about your essay before revising it to make sure you have a clear plan for revisions.


## Questions
Please email me anytime with questions or concerns, including whether a particular source will work with the assignment. It is always worthwhile to talk about these things in class, too. Don't hesitate to ask.
