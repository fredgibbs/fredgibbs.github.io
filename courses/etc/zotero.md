# How to Access the Course Zotero Library

[Zotero](http://zotero.org) is a free and popular tool developed by academics for academics for managing bibliographies to share resources like PDFs.

To access the course readings, you'll need to join the Zotero Group Library for the course.

## Step 1: Create a Zotero account
If you don't have one already, [sign up for a free account at zotero.org](https://www.zotero.org/user/register). Creating a Zotero account requires only that you specify a username, password, and email address. You will not get any spam from Zotero or anyone else because of your Zotero account. **Use your UNM email address!!!!!**


## Step 2: Find the email invitation and click the link in the message
On the first day of class, you will get an email from zotero.org inviting you to join the group library for the course. For security reasons I cannot simply add you to the group: **You must click the link in the invitation email!**


## Step 3: Click the join button on the website
After you click the link in the email, you end up at zotero.org. It may ask you to log in, if you're not already. If you log in but then end up at the zotero.org home screen, click the link in the email again to go to the course library page.

Once you're on the group library page, you'll see a red "join" button off to the right. Click this button to join the group!


## Step 4: Verify you can see the course library online
Reload the webpage, and you should now be able to see the course library (the link is on the syllabus home page). When you do this, you'll see a listing of course readings. When you double click one of these, a PDF of the reading should open.


## TROUBLESHOOTING FAQs

### I'm on zotero.org, but I don't know how to find the group library page.
- Click on the "groups" tab at the top. If you don't see a link to the course library, then either you aren't logged into zotero.org or you haven't joined the group yet. Restart at Step 1, or see last FAQ.

### I can see the items on the group library page, but I can't open any PDFs.
- First, check that you're logged in to zotero.org. If you are, there will be a "Log In" link in the upper right corner of the page.
- If you ARE logged in, then you haven't joined the group library. Restart at Step 1, or see last FAQ.

### Nothing is working. How do I join the group library?
- Go to zotero.org and make sure you're logged in. You'll see "Log Out" in the upper right of the page if you are.
- Click the groups tab.
- Search for the course library name (noted on the home page of the syllabus) IN QUOTES.
- Be sure the "groups" tab for searching is selected
- Click on the group library link (there will be just one if you searched with quotes)
- Click the red "Join" button, which will send an email to me and I'll add you as soon as I see it.

## HIGHLY RECOMMENDED: Install Zotero on your computer
Using the Zotero website to access the readings will always work, but it's seriously clunky. If you [download and install Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/download/) on your computer, you'll have a much faster and clearer interface to the readings. Use the "Standalone" version. It is a small application that is entirely safe to install.

While in the process of installing the Zotero application, you'll have the option to link your installation of Zotero to your online zotero.org account. Be sure to do this. If you complete the installation and have not told Zotero (the application) about your zotero.org account, go into the Zotero preferences menu (however you get to application preferences menus on your platform), and select the "Sync" tab. You can enter your username and password there.

Once you have connected the Zotero app to your zotero.org account, you will see on the leftmost column of your Zotero display, near the bottom, a “Group Libraries” header, and you'll see a  folder with the name of our group library for the course; click on that to see all the readings.

Double clicking an item opens a PDF, just like on zotero.org.

CAREFUL: **If an item has multiple PDFs associated with it** (like two book chapter scans), you'll need to click on the arrow to see all the associated PDFs for that item and double click the one you want to open. Just double clicking the item opens whichever PDF comes first alphabetically.

If you've only recently joined the group library, Zotero will take a few minutes to download all the readings, but eventually you'll have all of them on your computer. If I update the Zotero library with a new reading (or a better scan or something like that), you'll automatically get it.


## Stay organized
Learning how to stay organized in your work (whether school or other professional endeavor) is a crucial skill that you'll want to develop sooner than later because it will save you tremendous amounts of time. You'll make more money, be happier, etc. This course is a great excuse to start experimenting with finding a process that works best for you. Your future self will thank you!
