# How to Access the Course Zotero Library

[Zotero](http://zotero.org) is a free and popular tool developed by academics for academics for managing bibliographies to share resources like PDFs.

To access the course readings, you'll need to join the Zotero Group Library for the course.

## Step 1a: Create a Zotero account
If you don't have one already, [sign up for a free account at zotero.org](https://www.zotero.org/user/register). Creating a Zotero account requires only that you specify a username, password, and email address. You will not get any spam from Zotero or anyone else because of your Zotero account. **Use your UNM email address!!!!!**

## Step 1b: Make sure you are logged into zotero.org
If you are, there will be a "Log Out" link in the upper right corner of the page.


## Step 2: Find the email invitation and click the link in the message
On the first day of class, you will get an email from zotero.org inviting you to join the our Zotero group library for the course. For security reasons I cannot simply add you to the group.Search your email for "zotero" and you'll probably find it. If you can't skip to the last FAQ below. **Click the link in the invitation email!**


## Step 3: Click the join button on the website
After you click the link in the email, you'll end up at zotero.org. You should be logged in (see Step 1b), and if you're not you'll see a "Log In" link. If you log in but then end up at the zotero.org home screen, click the link in the invitation email again to go to the course library page.

Once you're on the group library page, you'll see a red "join" button off to the right. Click this button to join the group! Everything should be good.


## Step 4: Verify you can see the course library online
Reload the webpage (Command-R or Control-R), and you should now be able to see the course library and all the readings for the semester. When you double click one of these, a PDF of the reading should open. If you can open a PDF this way, everything is working.


## TROUBLESHOOTING FAQs

### I'm logged into zotero.org, but I don't know how to find the group library for the course.
- Click on the "groups" tab at the top. If you don't see a link to the course library, then either you really aren't logged into zotero.org OR you haven't joined the group yet. Make sure you're logged in and restart and Step 2.

### I can see the items on the group library page, but I can't open any PDFs.
- First, check that you're logged in to zotero.org. If you are, there will be a "Log Out" link in the upper right corner of the page.
- If you ARE logged in, but can't get any PDFs to open, then you haven't joined the group library. Restart at Step 2, or see last FAQ.

### Nothing is working and this is super annoying. What do I do now?
- Go to zotero.org and make sure you're logged in. If you are, there will be a "Log Out" link in the upper right corner of the page.
- Click the groups tab.
- Search for the course library name (noted on the home page of the syllabus) IN QUOTES.
- Be sure the "groups" tab for searching is selected.
- Click on the group library link (there will be just one if you searched with quotes)
- Click the red "Join" button, which will send an email to me and I'll approve your request to join as soon as I see it.

## HIGHLY RECOMMENDED: Install Zotero on your computer
Using the Zotero website to access the readings will always work, but it's seriously clunky. I HIGHLY recommend that you [download and install Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/download/) on your computer, so you'll have a much faster, convenient, and clearer interface to the readings. Use the "Standalone" version. It is a small app that is entirely safe to install.

While in the process of installing the Zotero app, you'll have the option to link your installation of Zotero to your online zotero.org account. Be sure to do this! If you complete the installation and have not told your Zotero app about your zotero.org account, go into the Zotero preferences menu (however you get to application preferences menus on your platform), and select the "Sync" tab. You can enter your username and password there.

Once you have connected the Zotero app to your zotero.org account, you will see on the leftmost column of your Zotero display, near the bottom, a “Group Libraries” header, and you'll see a  folder with the name of our group library for the course; click on that to see all the readings for the semester.

Double clicking an item opens a PDF, just like on zotero.org.

CAREFUL: **If an item has multiple PDFs associated with it** (like two book chapter scans), you'll need to click on the arrow to the left of that item to see all the associated PDFs for that item. Then you can double click the one you want to open. Just double clicking the item opens whichever PDF comes first alphabetically (which normally works since there is normally just one PDF per item).

If you've only recently joined the group library, Zotero will take a few minutes to download all the PDFs, but eventually you'll have all of them on your computer. If I update the Zotero library with a new reading (or a better scan or something like that), you'll automatically get it.


## Stay organized
Especially if you ever have bibliographic research to do, Zotero is incredibly helpful in keeping your sources organized and creating bibliographies for you. Learning how to stay organized in your work (whether school or other professional endeavor) is a crucial skill that you'll want to develop sooner than later because it will save you tremendous amounts of time. You'll make more money, be happier, etc. This course is a great excuse to start experimenting with finding a process that works best for you. Your future self will thank you!
