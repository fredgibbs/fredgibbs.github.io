# How to Access the Course Zotero Library

[Zotero](http://zotero.org) is a free tool developed by academics for academics for managing bibliographies used by millions of people around the world. It also helps groups of scholars (that's us!) share resources like PDFs. That's why we'll use it.

There are two ways of getting course readings through the course Zotero Library.

1. Use the [Zotero.org](http://zotero.org) website to access the materials online as you need them.
2. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED: Install Zotero onto your computer. You get a much better interface and can access the readings offline (and take notes, etc).

**There are a few preliminary steps that everyone must do regardless of how you intend to access the readings. You will have no trouble if you follow these steps carefully and in order.** I am happy to help you if you have problems, but please be sure you have followed the directions carefully.


## Step 1: Create an account at zotero.org
Regardless of which method you use, **you must [sign up for a free account at zotero.org](https://www.zotero.org/user/register)**. Creating a Zotero account requires only that you specify a username, password, and email address. You will not get any spam from Zotero or anyone else because of your Zotero account. **Use your UNM email address!!!!!**


## Step 2: Find the email invitation and click the link in the message
On the first day of class, you will get an email from zotero.org that will invite you to join the group library for the course. For security reasons I cannot simply add you to the group: **You must click the link in the invitation email to join the group!**


## Step 3: Click the join button on the website
After you click the link in the email, you end up at zotero.org, and there is an Accept button to join the library. You must click this button to join the group!


## Step 4: Verify you can see the course library online
Now you'll be able to visit the course library (the link is on the syllabus home page). When you do this, you'll see a listing of course readings. When you click one of these links, you'll see at the bottom a link to a PDF. 


## TROUBLESHOOTING
If you go to the course library page (on the syllabus home page),
If you're not sure where you are at zotero.org, click the "groups" link in the menu bar. If you don't see a link to `diet-health-expertise-unm` then either you aren't logged into zotero.org or you haven't joined the group yet.


## HIGHLY RECOMMENDED: Install Zotero on your computer
Using the Zotero website to access the readings will always work, but it's seriously clunky. If you [download and install Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/download/) on your computer, you'll have a much faster and clearer interface to the readings. Use the "Standalone" version. It is a small application that is entirely safe to install.

While in the process of installing the Zotero application, you'll have the option to link your installation of Zotero to your online zotero.org account. Be sure to do this. If you complete the installation and have not told Zotero (the application) about your zotero.org account, go into the settings menu (the gear icon), and select the "Sync" tab. You can enter your username and password there.

Once you have connected the Zotero app to your zotero.org account, you will see on the leftmost column of your Zotero display, near the bottom, a “Group Libraries” header with a little arrow next to it. Click the arrow, and click on the course folder.

If you've only recently joined the group library, Zotero will take a few minutes to download all the readings, but eventually you'll have all of them on your computer. If I update the Zotero library with a new reading (or a better scan or something like that), you'll automatically get it.


## Stay organized
Learning how to stay organized in your work (whether school or other professional endeavor) is a crucial skill that you'll want to develop sooner than later because it will save you tremendous amounts of time. You'll make more money, be happier, etc. This course is a great excuse to start experimenting with finding a process that works best for you. Your future self will thank you!
