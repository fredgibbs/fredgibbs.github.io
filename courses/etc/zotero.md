# A Breif Zotero Guide

[Zotero](http://zotero.org) is a free and popular tool developed by academics for academics for managing bibliographies to share resources like PDFs.

Consult the syllabus for details about how to connect to Zotero for your course. This guide explains in more detail how to use the platform and troubleshooting


## Using Zotero
Once you've joined the group library, you can access all the readings on the Library Page. The Readings and Books section of the syllabus home page will have the specific link you need for the course library.

Double-clicking a reading will bring up the PDF attached to it.

A few items in our Zotero library have more than one PDF attached to them. If you're getting the wrong chapter when double-clicking at item: Single click on the item to select it, then click the "Attachments" tab near the upper right of the page. You'll see links to all PDFs for that item and you can select the PDF you need and click the icon to open it.



## TROUBLESHOOTING FAQs

### I can see the items on the group library page, but I can't find/open any PDFs.
- Everyone can SEE items in the library, even when not logged into zotero.org. You can only access the PDFs if you have JOINED the library.
- First, check that you're logged in to zotero.org.
- If you ARE logged in, but can't get any PDFs to open, then you haven't joined the group library. Follow the directions from steps 1 or 2.

### I keep getting the wrong PDF when I double-click a reading in the library.
A few items in our Zotero library have more than one PDF attached to them. If you're getting the wrong chapter when double-clicking at item: Single click on the item to select it, then click the "Attachments" tab near the upper right of the page. You'll see links to all PDFs for that item and you can select the PDF you need and click the icon to open it.

### I'm logged into zotero.org, but I can't find the group library for the course.
- Click on the "groups" tab or link at the top of the page and you should see a link to the group homepage.
- If you don't see a link to the course library on the main part of the page then either you aren't logged into zotero.org or you haven't yet joined our group.
- The easiest way to get to the group library, and make sure you're going to the right spot, is to use the link on the syllabus.



## HIGHLY RECOMMENDED: Install Zotero on your computer
Using the Zotero website to access the readings will always work, but it's seriously clunky. I HIGHLY recommend that you [download and install Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/download/) on your computer, so you'll have a much faster, convenient, and clearer interface to the readings. Use the "Standalone" version. It is a small app that is entirely safe to install.

While in the process of installing the Zotero app, you'll have the option to link your installation of Zotero to your online zotero.org account. Be sure to do this! If you complete the installation and have not told your Zotero app about your zotero.org account, go into the Zotero preferences menu (however you get to application preferences menus on your platform), and select the "Sync" tab. You can enter your username and password there.

Once you have connected the Zotero app to your zotero.org account, you will see on the leftmost column of your Zotero display, near the bottom, a “Group Libraries” header, and you'll see a  folder with the name of our group library for the course; click on that to see all the readings for the semester.

Double clicking an item opens a PDF, just like on zotero.org.

CAREFUL: **If an item has multiple PDFs associated with it** (like two book chapter scans), you'll need to click on the arrow to the left of that item to see all the associated PDFs for that item. Then you can double click the one you want to open. Just double clicking the item opens whichever PDF comes first alphabetically (which normally works since there is normally just one PDF per item).

If you've only recently joined the group library, Zotero will take a few minutes to download all the PDFs, but eventually you'll have all of them on your computer. If I update the Zotero library with a new reading (or a better scan or something like that), you'll automatically get it.


## Stay organized
Especially if you ever have bibliographic research to do, Zotero is incredibly helpful in keeping your sources organized and creating bibliographies for you. Learning how to stay organized in your work (whether school or other professional endeavor) is a crucial skill that you'll want to develop sooner than later because it will save you tremendous amounts of time. You'll make more money, be happier, etc. This course is a great excuse to start experimenting with finding a process that works best for you. Your future self will thank you!
