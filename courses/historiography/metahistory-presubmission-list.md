# _Metahistory_ Presubmission checklist
Below are some last things to check before you submit your final pull request. At this point, your writing is essentially done, so these are all detail-oriented items that help prevent your essay from looking sloppy. Having a lot of inconsistencies and errors makes your essay less trustworthy, even if the writing and research is otherwise strong.

## Check the basics
MOST IMPORTANTLY: Make sure you are meeting the BASIC REQUIREMENTS and following the READABILITY checklist as outlined in the [writing guide](metahistory-guide).

## So What Question
Now that your writing is basically done, and the writing process has helped you figure out what to say and how to say it, make sure your essay both very near the beginning and at the end makes it very clear what the reader is meant to take away as the main point(s). In other words, the essay needs to very obviously answer the SO WHAT question.

## Metadata
- Make sure the filename of your essay is similar to the title---and NOT YOUR NAME.
- Make sure the filename of your essay is in ALL LOWER CASE and uses HYPHENS INSTEAD OF SPACES.
- Make sure your title uses Title Case. All non-article words should be capitalized---just make your title look like the others.


## Images & Captions
- Make sure all your images are showing up!
- Make sure you have informative captions that explain the significance of what the image shows.
- Make sure your [source] links actually work.


## Double check your citations

### In-text citations
- Use the format of (Author-last-name, page-number). No p. or pg. or pp. or any other abbreviations; just indicate the page number.
- Make sure the author's name is spelled correctly!
- Make sure the name you cite in the text is listed the same way in the bibliography.
- The citation goes INSIDE the period for the sentence
- EXAMPLE: Here is my sentence (Breisach, 96).

### Bibliographies
- Be sure you're using standard Chicago style citations for your bibliography. See the bibliography entries at the [Chicago Manual of Style Online](https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/tools_citationguide/citation-guide-1.html).
- DO NOT include URLs or DOIs, unless the original is only online and there is no print version. In this case, you should provide a hyperlink (not just a URL) to the text.
- EXAMPLE: Breisach, Ernst. _Historiography: Ancient, Medieval, & Modern._ University of Chicago Press, 2007.
