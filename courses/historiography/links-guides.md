# Links and Guides
This page contains a list of links that you will probably need repeatedly throughout the term. Some of these links are to assignment guides that provide explicit directions on how to set up tools and complete required assignments. Some documents don't exist yet but will appear here when they do, and always well in advance of when you need them. Early set-up guides for Zotero and GitHub are not here--only on the schedule page, since you shouldn't need them more than once.
