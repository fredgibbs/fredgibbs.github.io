# IN PROGRESS!
This syllabus is a guide, not a contract. As a living document that changes frequently depending on what's going on with our group, you'll want to bookmark and consult the online version of this syllabus frequently. Important links to online assignment guides and other instructions will appear throughout the course, and I will always announce important changes in class. No significant changes will be made to the overall workload. If you print out the syllabus, be sure you keep your paper version up to date with the online version.
