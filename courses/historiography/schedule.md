# Schedule of Readings + Assignments

## Decoding the syllabus
- Regular bullet points listed under each day is what you need to READ BEFORE CLASS.
- Usually there are one or two items; occasionally there are three, like when we have short book chapters.

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Red boxes' text="
These indicate something you have to DO/POST BEFORE CLASS, usually by 9am.
"%}

{% include alert.html class='info' title='Blue boxes' text="
These indicate what we'll be discussing in class, usually with additional links for reference. If there is no blue box for one of our meeting days, there's just a usual class discussion and no need for a special box.
"%}

{% include alert.html class='warning' title='Yellow Boxes' text="
These indicate something should note to make life easier, but aren't anything you need to turn in.
"%}

### 8: Early Modern History
- Eileen Ka-May Chang, _Historiography_, 4--28 (Chap 1: Art and Science in Renaissance Historical Writing).
- Niccolò Machiavelli, _The Prince_, 5-19. (These are really small pages.)

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Reading Reflection' text="
- There's a lot of stuff in the chapter, but what would you consider the key developments in Renaissance history writing?
- Give a few examples from _The Prince_ that illustrate what's changing in terms of how history is being used in Renaissance Europe (esp Florence)?
"%}




## Week 4

### 13: Enlightenment History
- Eileen Ka-May Chang, _Historiography_, 29--60 (Chap 2: Enlightenment and Philosophical History).

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Reading reflection' text="
How did Enlightenment thinking get applied to History?
"%}


### 15: Romantic and Critical History
- Eileen Ka-May Chang, _Historiography_, 61--90 (Chap 3: Romantic and Critical History).

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Reading reflection' text="
- What would you say are the key differences between Romantic and Critical history?

"%}



## Week 6

### 27: Gender Histories
- Joan Scott, "Gender: A Useful Category of Historical Analysis", 1053-1075.

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Reading reflection' text="
This is a classic article that seems dated now. But it still makes a number of useful points that are still relevant and more to our purposes, shows how historians can directly shape the way history is written. Many students assume this article is trying to argue that historians should pay more attention to the role women in history. It does argue that, but the main point is actually much more interesting and nuanced? What is it?
"%}


### 29: Postcolonial Histories
- Dipesh Chakrabarty, "Postcoloniality and the Artifice of History: Who Speaks for 'Indian' Pasts?", 1-27.

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Reading reflection' text="
This is another classic article that can also feel a bit out of date, yet another example of how historians can directly shape the way history is written by asking profound questions and offering new perspectives that were too easily unquestioned.
"%}



## Week 7

### 4: Archival Power
- Joan M. Schwartz and Terry Cook, “Archives, Records and Power: The Making of Modern Memory,” 1–19. This article is a little repetitive at times, but in a good way, as it makes it easy to understand the main points. It is shorter than it looks in terms of page count because many pages are almost entirely footnotes (which you can peruse if you're interested).


{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Reading reflection' text="
- What are the key ways archives manifest their power?
- Before this article, how much have you thought about how archives help shape the future as much as they represent the past?  
"%}


### 6: Archival Silence
- Rodney G. S. Carter, “Of Things Said and Unsaid: Power, Archival Silences, and Power in Silence” _Archivaria_, September 25, 2006, 215–33.

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Reading reflection' text="
- Softball question as we wind up the first half: What ideas in the article were most and least intersting?
"%}



## Week 8

### 11: TBD

### 13: NO CLASS: Enjoy Fall Break!!!



## Week 9
This week we're starting our one book for the course. It's rather theoretical and abstract at times (most of the time, actually), but that challenge is by design. One of the aims of the course is that you can think abstractly about key issues in history and broaden your ability to think abstractly about ANYthing. That's what senior-level capstone seminars should do, in my opinion. There will be paragraphs or even pages where you will be confused about what the authors is trying to say. It's true for me, too! Don't be discouraged that you're not "getting it". It's not easy and it's not meant to be. We'll work through the main points in our discussion and I think you'll agree that once we work through it together, it gives us powerful new tools for interpreting not only history, but any kind of text.

### 18: _Historical Theory_ I
- _Historical Theory_, 3--11 (Ch. 1: Introduction).
- _Historical Theory_, 12--30 (Ch. 2: The Contested Nature of Historical Knowledge).

### 27: _Historical Theory_ IV
- _Historical Theory_, 122--140 (Ch. 7: Satisfying Curiosity).



## Week 11

### 1: _Historical Theory_ V

"%}



## Week 12

- Challenges and necessity of public history
- Basic research process that you should use for your essays. This ensures you will be selecting appropriate sources, and using and citing them appropriately.
"%}

{% include alert.html class='warning' title='Don\'t procrastinate with citations!' text="
If you just write stuff down and don't bother citing where you found it, you will have to eventually hunt down all the page numbers and THAT'S A HUGE WASTE OF TIME. As someone who has wasted considerable time on just that, please take my advice: take time to make accurate references AS YOU WRITE.
"%}



## Week 13

### 15: History as Data
- SKIM: Margo Anderson, "Quantitative History", 246-59.
- Laura Spinney, [History as a giant data set: how analysing the past could help save the future](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/nov/12/history-as-a-giant-data-set-how-analysing-the-past-could-help-save-the-future)

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Reading Reflection' text="
  - Is quantitative history fundamentally different from 'regular' history?
  - To what extent will all history gradually become quantitative history (as sources are born-digital or become digitized)?  
  - How does this suggestion problem solving through history conflict with uses of history as we've seen them so far in the course?
"%}

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Annotated Bibliographies Due' text="

## Week 14
### 22: NO CLASS: Work on your essay drafts!

### 24: NO CLASS: Happy Thanksgiving!
{% include alert.html class='danger' title='COMPLETE Drafts Due' text="
No class today, but you must post by the end of the day a COMPLETE draft for your essay, which should be around at least 2000 words (with the final being 2500). With no reading assignment, this is obviously your focus, so DO IT WELL and save everyone (including your future self) headaches later.

'Draft' does not mean some half-baked sketch hastily thrown together so you have something to post. It means a COMPLETE FIRST VERSION that we can all respond to in a meaningful way. If your post is too hastily thrown together, you will need to revise and resubmit it immediately to get credit for completing the assignment.

Your essays will undergo peer review over the weekend, so you should have a **TOTALLY COMPLETE** and REASONABLY POLISHED draft following the [writing guide](https://unm-historiography.github.io/intro-guide/writing-guide).
"%}



## Week 15

### 29: NO CLASS: Happy Post-Thanksgiving!

Bring your TWO ~500 word critiques on TWO different essays. Review assignments are posted [in our repository](https://github.com/unm-historiography/2019-fall/blob/master/review-assignments.md). Focus on the big picture: framing, historiographical significance, and accessibility for the intended audience. Be sure you are thinking about the points raised in the [writing guide](https://unm-historiography.github.io/intro-guide/writing-guide).
"%}
