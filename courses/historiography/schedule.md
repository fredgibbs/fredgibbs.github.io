### Scientific and Philosophical History 1

**NOTE ASSIGNMENT CHANGE for the 26th and 28th**    
_Group 1:_ You will be summarizers for the chapter. Please pull out key ideas, quotes, historiographical changes, etc., that we should record for future use while working our collaborative web project. Do not feel compelled to follow the "summarizer" role as we had before. If you'd have a comment or important questions to contribute, please count those points as part of your summary.

_Group 2:_ As per our discussion last time, you will propose and defend a structure for our historiography web project. Namely, how much should we follow Kelley's lead? What other chronological divisions should we use? Should any chapters be divided up differently? Are there certain themes and topics that we should highlight separate from the chronological progression? How do we want people to use our historiography website? How can we create something that stands on its own but also werves as a foundation for further expansion (depth or breadth)?

If you are not sure of what group you are now in (because you weren't in class or you forgot), use this formula: old groups 1 and 2 are now in group 1; old groups 3 and 4 are now in group 2. OTHERWISE, use the group number you counted off in class. 

26: _Faces_, 188-216.  

28: _Faces_, 217-249.  


### Scientific and Philosophical History 2
3: Sharon Anderson-Gold, "Kant and Herder," 457-67; Herder, _Reflections of the Philosophy of History of Mankind_, 3-33. This primary source you should generally skim, but pick your spots to read more carefully when something interests you. If nothing interests you, pick spots at random.  

5: Tom Rockmore, "Hegel," 468-476; Hegel, _The Philosophy of History_, 1-27; Wilhelm von Humboldt, "On the Historian's Task," 57-71 (skim).  

 
### Professionalization 
10: PROJECT WORKSHOP. Bring TWO copies of your detailed outlines to class. We will exchange them and provide critical feedback on each others' work. Bringing in a half-baked outline will only frustrate your reviewer and keep your work behind schedule (and my dissatisfaction will be reflected in your grade of the copy you turn into me). 

12: Thomas Gil, "Leopold Ranke," 383-92; Ranke (in Wines), 55-67; Felix Gilbert, "What Ranke Meant," _The American Scholar_ 56.3 (1987): 393-397. (previously: Guenther Roth, "History and Sociology in the Work of Max Weber," 306-18.)

ASSIGNMENT: Over the weekend, revise your expanded outlines into prose in MARKDOWN. Use appropriate headings and typography! 

### Empirical History
17: PROJECT WORKSHOP (I'm away). Bring in revisions (paper or digital) so that someone else (and someone different from last week) can critique your essay.

19: _Houses_, "Empiricists," 1-31.; _Houses_, "Marxist Historians," 33-58. Everyone will skim both chapters, but pick one to focus on and write (and post to GitHub) a standard comment (400-500 words) on the kind of history you see being done in the source extract. Using examples, illustrate the pros and cons of his approach to doing history. Does the sample reading jive with how it's described in the introductory section?

NOTE: Begin finding sources for your outside research!

### Counting History
24: _Houses_, "The _Annales_," 87-109. 

DUE: A 400-500 word comment on the chapter, following the same questions as before: Using examples, illustrate the pros and cons of his approach to doing history. Does the sample reading jive with how it's described in the introductory section? (this will be the standard assignment for _Houses_ chapter for now on)

ALSO DUE: Bring hardcopies of your chapters, which you will have revised from your workshop on Monday. Remember that we want to follow the _Houses_ style of clarity, accessibility, and brevity. 

NOTE: For everyone, but mostly for those of you who did not attend the writing workshop (please let me know if you did but didn't sign the sign-in sheet), bring the best draft you can. We will determine if you have made enough progress that we can keep your essay in the web project. If not, it probably makes more sense for you to do the original book review assignemnt instead, so as not to drag the project down and compromise everyone else's hard work on it.

You will exchange papers with a suiutable partner (as discussed on the 19th), carefully critique them and do lots of scribbling on them before Wednesday, and bring to them class on Wednesday to re-exchange with your partner. More revisions will ensue for the next class (31st).

26: _Houses_, "Quantitative History," 141-171.


### Foucault: Discourse and Observation
