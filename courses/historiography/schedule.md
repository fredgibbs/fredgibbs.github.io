# Schedule of Readings & Assignments

## Decoding the syllabus
- Regular bullet points listed under each day are stuff you need to READ BEFORE CLASS.
- Usually there are one or two items; occasionally there are three, like when we have short book chapters.

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Red boxes' text="
These are something you have to TURN IN for that day, BEFORE CLASS, usually 10am.
"%}

{% include alert.html class='info' title='Blue boxes' text="
These are usually notes about what we'll be discussing in class, usually with additional links for reference. If there is no blue box for one of our meeting days, it's just a usual class discussion.
"%}

{% include alert.html class='warning' title='Yellow Boxes' text="
These are warnings about something that you should note, but aren't an assignment you need to turn in.

- Readings TBP




## Week 3

### 6: NO CLASS (Labor Day)

### 8: Early Modern History + Enlightenment History

## Week 4

### 13: Leopold von Ranke and Professional History
- Jeremy D. Popkin, _From Herodotus to H-Net_, "The 19th century and the rise of academic scholarship", 68-96.

This article is a little repetitive at times, but in a good way as it makes it easy to understand the main points. It is shorter than it looks in terms of page count because many pages are almost entirely footnotes (which you can peruse if you're interested).

### 6: Archival Silence

## Week 8

### 11: TBD

### 13: NO CLASS: Enjoy Fall Break!!!



## Week 9
This week we're starting our one book for the course. It's rather theoretical and abstract at times (most of the time, actually), but that challenge is by design. One of the aims of the course is that you can think abstractly about key issues in history and broaden your ability to think abstractly about ANYthing. That's what senior-level capstone seminars should do, in my opinion. There will be paragraphs or even pages where you will be confused about what the authors is trying to say. It's true for me, too! Don't be discouraged that you're not "getting it". It's not easy and it's not meant to be. We'll work through the main points in our discussion and I think you'll agree that once we work through it together, it gives us powerful new tools for interpreting not only history, but any kind of text.

### 18: _Historical Theory_ I
- _Historical Theory_, 3--11 (Ch. 1: Introduction).
- _Historical Theory_, 12--30 (Ch. 2: The Contested Nature of Historical Knowledge).
- _Historical Theory_, 31--50 (Ch. 3: Historical Paradigms and Theoretical Traditions).

### 20: _Historical Theory_ II
- _Historical Theory_, 53--73 (Ch. 4: Beyond Metanarrative: Plots, Puzzles, and Plausibility).



## Week 10

### 25: _Historical Theory_ III
- _Historical Theory_, 74--97 (Ch. 5: Labelling the Parts: Categories and Concepts).
- _Historical Theory_, 98--121 (Ch. 6: Looking for Clues).

### 27: _Historical Theory_ IV
- _Historical Theory_, 122--140 (Ch. 7: Satisfying Curiosity).



## Week 11

### 1: _Historical Theory_ V
- _Historical Theory_, 143--163 (Ch. 8: Representing the Past).
- _Historical Theory_, 164--184 (Ch. 9: History and Partisanship).

### 3: _Historical Theory_ VI
- _Historical Theory_, 185--196 (Ch. 10: Conclusion).
- Peruse the [Metahistory site](https://unm-historiography.github.io/metahistory/) again so you are familiar with the essays, their style, strengths and weaknesses. Pick an essay you want to edit according to the [revision guide](revision-guide).

{% include alert.html class='info' title='In class' text="
- _Historical Theory_ Wrap up discussion
- Discuss the editing assignment due next Monday, including the process for editing and posting revisions. There will be a new version of this [screencast](https://youtu.be/tLAaLmHkKZU).
"%}



## Week 12
### 8: Metahistory Review and Historiographical Research Methods
- No new reading

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Essay revisions due' text="
Complete, commit, and create a pull request your edits. Please make sure you are following the [revision guide](revision-guide).
"%}

{% include alert.html class='info' title='In class' text="
What questions do we need to be asking to make _Metahistory_ most usable for students learning the basics of historiography?
- What are the strengths and weaknesses of what's already there?
- What you find to be lacking?
- What kinds of topics aren't there that should be?
- Where did you get confused in class and wished you had a essay to help you?
- What topic do you want to write about?
"%}



### 10: Public History

{% include alert.html class='info' title='In class' text="
Today we'll go over the basic research process that you should use for your essays. This ensures you will be selecting appropriate sources, and using and citing them appropriately.
"%}

{% include alert.html class='warning' title='Save time' text="
### Don't procrastinate with citations!
If you just write stuff down and don't bother citing where you found it, you will have to eventually hunt down all the page numbers and THAT'S A HUGE WASTE OF TIME. As someone who has wasted considerable time on just that, please take my advice: take time to make accurate references AS YOU WRITE.
"%}



## Week 13

### 15: History as Data
- SKIM: Margo Anderson, "Quantitative History", 246-59.
- Laura Spinney, [History as a giant data set: how analysing the past could help save the future](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/nov/12/history-as-a-giant-data-set-how-analysing-the-past-could-help-save-the-future)

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Reading Reflection' text="
  - Is quantitative history fundamentally different from 'regular' history?
  - To what extent will all history gradually become quantitative history (as sources are born-digital or become digitized)?  
  - How does this suggestion problem solving through history conflict with uses of history as we've seen them so far in the course?
"%}


### 17: Digital History
- No new readings, but you need to post your annotated bibliographies to GitHub for class discussion

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Annotated Bibliographies Due' text="

"%}

{% include alert.html class='info' title='In class' text="
Presentation on Digital History Projects: Past, Present, and Future
"%}



## Week 14
### 22: NO CLASS: Work on your essay drafts!

### 24: NO CLASS: Happy Thanksgiving!
{% include alert.html class='danger' title='COMPLETE Drafts Due' text="
No class today, but you must post by the end of the day a COMPLETE draft for your essay, which should be around at least 2000 words (with the final being 2500). With no reading assignment, this is obviously your focus, so DO IT WELL and save everyone (including your future self) headaches later.

'Draft' does not mean some half-baked sketch hastily thrown together so you have something to post. It means a COMPLETE FIRST VERSION that we can all respond to in a meaningful way. If your post is too hastily thrown together, you will need to revise and resubmit it immediately to get credit for completing the assignment.

Your essays will undergo peer review over the weekend, so you should have a **TOTALLY COMPLETE** and REASONABLY POLISHED draft following the [writing guide](https://unm-historiography.github.io/intro-guide/writing-guide).
"%}



## Week 15

### 29: NO CLASS: Happy Post-Thanksgiving!

Bring your TWO ~500 word critiques on TWO different essays. Review assignments are posted [in our repository](https://github.com/unm-historiography/2019-fall/blob/master/review-assignments.md). Focus on the big picture: framing, historiographical significance, and accessibility for the intended audience. Be sure you are thinking about the points raised in the [writing guide](https://unm-historiography.github.io/intro-guide/writing-guide).
"%}



## Week 16
### 6: Publishing your essay
- No new readings.

{% include alert.html class='info' title='In class' text="
- Review the steps necessary to publish your essay on the official Metahistory site. This process is basically the same as when you committed your revisions a few weeks ago. There are a few additional concerns since you're making a NEW essay this time. Your final version must be posted by December 13.
"%}


{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Table of Contents' text="
- BEFORE CLASS ON WEDNESDAY, update our [Table of Contents Data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EBAxMEabmmgxiU_0yabIDr6r8Cnevtv63KXDbae33T4/edit#gid=0). Double check your abstract, image, and the link.
