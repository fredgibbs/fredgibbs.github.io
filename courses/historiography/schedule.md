# IN PROGRESS!
This syllabus is a guide, not a contract. As a living document that changes depending on how things are going, you'll want to bookmark and consult the online version of this syllabus frequently. Important links to online assignment guides and other instructions will appear throughout the course, and I will always announce important changes in class. No significant changes will be made to the overall workload. If you print out the syllabus, be sure you keep your paper version up to date with the online version.

"%}


## Week 2

### 26: Philosophy of History
- _PoH_, 1-13.
{% include alert.html class='info' title='Leave time for GitHub' text="
A short reading assignment, partially to let you get used to posting on GitHub. Everyone should post a comment on the following, drawing from the previous two readings and your own personal experience:
- What is history for?
- What's the difference between studying the philosophy of history and historiography?
- How is historiography useful outside of the academy?
"%}

### 28: Pre-classical History + Greco-Roman History
- _PoH_,  14-27; 28-44.


## Week 3

### 2: NO CLASS (Labor Day)

### 4: Medieval History
* _PoH_, 45-73.  



## Week 4

### 9: Early Modern Historiographical Revolutions
- _PoH_, 74-106.
- Niccolò Machiavelli, _The Prince_, 5-19. (These are really small pages.) Everyone should come to class prepared to discuss: What examples from _The Prince_ illustrate what's in the chapter? How does it draw from previous historiographic traditions?

{% include alert.html class='info' title='Review posts from last time' text="
We're going to tie up some loose ends from last time, so we can be most efficient if you review the excellent questions and comments you produced for last Wednesday's class.
"%}

### 11: Interlude?
- _PoH_, 107-126.
- Discussion of [Intro Guide](https://unm-historiography.github.io/intro-guide/) assignment due Monday.


## Week 5

### 16: Giambattista Vico (1668-1744)
- _PoH_, 127-167. Skim 137-160. You should still read these pages---they are actually quite interesting as perhaps the first comprehensive theory of history---but read quickly as to not get bogged down in the details.

{% include alert.html class='info' title='The Intro Guide' text="

**As you look over the intro guide, stay out of the weeds!** Really specific criticism about a particular essay is not particularly helpful at this stage. Keep your analysis focused on the big picture and the overall project.

Maintaining our four groups:
- **Questioners**: What questions to we need to be asking of ourselves to make this most usable for an early college student? These should be a product of surveying what's already in the guide and thinking about what should or should not be in it as well as how it should be done.
- **Summarizers**: What are the strengths and weaknesses of what's already here and what you find to be lacking?
- **Commenters**: Can early college students learn the BASICS of historiography from this KIND of resource? Don't limit your analysis simply to what is already on the site. What should the key features be? Can such a guide be a way of helping students to reimagine what history is?
- **Slackers**: You don't need to write anything, but as always be ready to contribute to our conversation.

Note: There is an overwhelming amount to be improved, so the assignment here is to some extent an exercise in stating the obvious---but it's an important first step. You will be graded on your effort to say something productive and improve the project.
"%}

### 18: Enlightenment
- _PoH_, 168-200.
- Discussion of editing assignment due next week


## Week 6

### 23: Hegel
- _PoH_, 201-237.

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='First edits due' text="
Consult the [Intro-guide revision guidelines](1st-revision-guide).

You can access the intro guide (I'm now calling it _Metahistory_ just for fun) [here](https://unm-historiography.github.io/intro-guide/).

Your first edits should be complete and visible on GitHub. Note that changes will be made in the [intro guide repository](https://github.com/unm-historiography/intro-guide), which is separate from the repository for our reading responses. We'll devote some class discussion time for evaluating these. There is nothing else to post for today, BUT:

Be prepared to discuss what’s significant with Hegel, what’s new with his view of history, and why should we care. There is a very high probability of me using the cards to keep everyone honest.

Remember that the first chunk (up to p. 213 or so) is an overview of his philosophy that you should read quickly. Slow down when it's more about his theory of history.
"%}

### 25: Marx
- _PoH_, 238-277.

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Image edits due' text="
We looked at the code page in class, but I split off the images stuff into their own file with more explicit directions for Wednesday. See [Embedding images in your essays](https://unm-historiography.github.io/intro-guide/loading-images).

The original [code samples](https://unm-historiography.github.io/intro-guide/code) are still available.

All you need to do is copy and paste the code from the gray box, and change the parameters (position, width, filename, etc).

- BE CAREFUL ABOUT QUOTATIONS! If you accidentally omit a quotation mark, the code won't work and the whole site will break.

- If you ever get an email or notification of a 'Page Build Failure', send me a quick email to let me know and I will look at what's wrong. There's a chance it's not with your file, so if you don't see anything wrong, just keep working and it will get resolved.

- If you get really confused or frustrated, relax. We'll work through issues on Wednesday and you can finish uploading code and images before Monday.
"%}

### 21: Postmodernism I
- Jeremy D. Popkin, _From Herodotus to H-Net_, "Glorious Confusion", 127-65.
{% include alert.html class='info' title='Get your new page working' text="
No posts for today, but complete the steps below (as explained on Monday) and start thinking about the assignment for Wednesday.
"%}
- Fork the intro-guide. Go to the [intro-guide repository](https://github.com/unm-historiography/intro-guide), and click the `Fork` button in the upper right corner (don't click the number).
- You'll see a popup window asking you where you want to fork it, and you'll click on your username (you should only have one choice).
- Notice where you are! You are looking at the intro-guide repository under YOUR OWN ACCOUNT. This is evident from the URL and the top left of the GitHub page. Our collection will always have `unm=-historiography` in it, and yours will have your GitHub username. But the files look exactly the same!
- Turn on your own repository's GitHub Pages website. Under the settings tab, scroll down to the `GitHub Pages` section (second from the bottom), and under `source`, change it from `none` to `master branch`. Scroll back down to the GitHub Pages section, and notice that it gives you a URL for your version of the intro-guide. It will look like https://USERNAME.github.io/intro-guide.
- Working in YOUR repository (which will look like https://github.com/USERNAME/intro-guide/), go into the `essays` folder and appropriate subfolder, and create a new page for your essay.
- Copy and paste the standard page header from the Code Examples page or copy the code from an existing page.
- Copy and paste image code from the Loading Images page or copy code from an existing page. You want to get one image to appear, just to make sure you have working code for it.
- Write a 1-2 paragraph abstract of what you'd intend to do in your essay. This is a starting point, not a final commitment, but be thorough.
- You can test your page by going to https://USERNAME.github.io/intro-guide/essays/FOLDER/FILENAME, where FOLDER is the folder in which you created a new file, and FILENAME is the name of your file.
- Get your page looking like you want within YOUR repository. Make sure there are no page build errors (you will get an email about them).
- You're done! We'll talk about integrating your new page with everyone else's later.


### 23: Postmodernism II
- _PoH_, 359-89.

{% include alert.html class='info' title='postmodernism so far' text="
Write a slightly-longer-than-normal-comment (600-800 words) about your take on postmodern history. Write/focus on whatever you like, but provide at least rough answers to the following kinds of questions (but don't just answer them one by one):
- How have our readings affected the way you think about history?
- Does postmodern history constitute a historiographical paradigm shift?
- Are late twentieth-century ways of writing about history that we've discussed a 'rupture' from previous historiographies?
- Or are they more on a continuum of historiographical change.
**These comments will be VERY useful for our Intro Guide.**
"%}



## Week 11

### 28: NO CLASS: Work on your essays!

### MAKE WORKING NOTES
As such, ask questions, makes notes to yourself and your colleagues (who will review your work later).

### DON'T FORGET CITATIONS
If you just write stuff down and don't bother citing where you found it, you will have to eventually hunt down all the page numbers and THAT'S A HUGE WASTE OF TIME. As someone who has wasted considerable time on just that, please take my advice: take time to make accurate references AS YOU WRITE.
"%}

"%}


## Week 12
### 4: Essay Drafts I

For today, post a COMPLETE draft for your essay. With no reading assignment, this is obviously your focus, so DO IT WELL and save everyone (including your future self) headaches later.

'Draft' does not mean some half-baked sketch hastily thrown together so you have something to post. It means a COMPLETE FIRST VERSION that we can all respond to in a meaningful way.
