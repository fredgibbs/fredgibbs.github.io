# IN PROGRESS!
This syllabus is a guide, not a contract. As a living document that changes depending on how things are going, you'll want to bookmark and consult the online version of this syllabus frequently. Important links to online assignment guides and other instructions will appear throughout the course, and I will always announce important changes in class. No significant changes will be made to the overall workload. If you print out the syllabus, be sure you keep your paper version up to date with the online version.

Write/focus on whatever you like, but provide at least rough answers to the following kinds of questions: how have our readings affected the way you think about history? Does postmodern history constitute a historiographical paradigm shift? In other words: Are late twentieth-century ways of writing about history that we've discussed a 'rupture' from previous historiographies? Or are they more on a continuum of historiographical change. Be interesting.

Everyone is a commenter for today, and you need to answer two questions to which you should devote roughly equal space:
1. Translate Foucault's main points (readers choice!) into clear and concise language.

"%}


## Week 12
### 4: Essay Outlines
{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Essay Outlines' text="
For today, post a COMPLETE outline for your essay. With no reading assignment, this is obviously your focus, so DO IT WELL and save everyone (including your future self) headaches later.

Your outline will be gradually expanded into your essay, so the better the topic points--WHICH WILL BECOME PARAGRAPHS LATER--the easier time you will have shifting your essay from topics (ideas) into prose (narrative).

Your topic points should include the crucial explanations for what's significant about what you're talking about--especially how it deviated from previous historiography at the time and its legacy.

Put your outlines in the [essays/outlines folder](https://github.com/unm-historiography/2019-fall/tree/master/essays/outlines)

### START BUILDING YOUR ZOTERO LIBRARY
For more instructions on what to do, [watch this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD8_6MZFI8c&feature=youtu.be).

### THESE ARE WORKING NOTES
As such, ask questions, makes notes to yourself and your colleagues (who will review your work later).

### DON'T FORGET CITATIONS
If you just write stuff down and don't bother citing where you found it, you will have to eventually hunt down all the page numbers and THAT'S A HUGE WASTE OF TIME. As someone who has wasted considerable time on just that, please take my advice: take time to make accurate references THE FIRST TIME.
"%}

### 6: Narrative history

"%}



## Week 13

### 11:
{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Expand Topic Points ' text="
Two steps for this assignment:

1) Improve your topic points according to feedback

2) Make them paragraphs (add/delete/combine as need be)

#### Be sure your paragraphs have an expressed purpose, contribute to your argument, and cite adequate sources.

"%}
### 13: Scales of history
* Kieran Healy, "Fuck nuance", 1-13.

{% include alert.html class='info' title='Discussion prep' text="
