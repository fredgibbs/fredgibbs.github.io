# Schedule of Readings + Assignments

## Decoding the syllabus
- Regular bullet points listed under each day is what you need to READ BEFORE CLASS.
- Usually there are one or two items; occasionally there are three, like when we have short book chapters.

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Red boxes' text="
These indicate something you have to DO/POST BEFORE CLASS, usually by 9am.
"%}

{% include alert.html class='info' title='Blue boxes' text="
These indicate what we'll be discussing in class, usually with additional links for reference. If there is no blue box for one of our meeting days, there's just a usual class discussion and no need for a special box.
"%}

{% include alert.html class='warning' title='Yellow Boxes' text="
These indicate something should note to make life easier, but aren't anything you need to turn in.
"%}

- What other ideas were especially interesting?
- Don't forget your 1-2 INFORMED questions!
"%}



## Week 3

### 6: NO CLASS (Labor Day)

### 8: Early Modern History
- Read through the _[Metahistory](https://unm-historiography.github.io/metahistory/essays/early-modern/reforming-history.html)_ essays on Early Modern historiography. There is a little overlap with the Cheng reading, but mostly they cover and emphasize quite different aspects of Renaissance historiography.
- Eileen Ka-May Cheng, _[Historiography](https://unm.worldcat.org/title/historiography-an-introductory-guide/oclc/787843567&referer=brief_results)_, 4--28 (Chap 1: Art and Science in Renaissance Historical Writing). Click the "View eBook" link to get to the actual online text.
- Niccol√≤ Machiavelli, _The Prince_, 5-19. (These are really small pages.)

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Reading Reflection' text="
- How would you characterize history writing during the Renaissance?
- As part of your essay, be sure to mention what you consider to be the key developments in Renaissance history writing?
- How does the excerpt from _The Prince_ illustrate what's changing in terms of how history is being used in Renaissance Europe (esp Florence)?
"%}

{% include alert.html class='info' title='In class' text="
- Early Modern History Reflection discussion
- How can we compare and contrast Cheng's chapter with the _Metahistory_ essays? Why are they so different?
"%}



## Week 4

### 13 <i class="fas fa-birthday-cake"></i>: Enlightenment History
- Read the one [_Metahistory_ essay](https://unm-historiography.github.io/metahistory/essays/enlightenment/enlightenment.html) on Enlightenment historiography. This is particularly useful for understanding the broader historical context and legacy of historiographical change.
- Eileen Ka-May Cheng, _[Historiography](https://unm.worldcat.org/title/historiography-an-introductory-guide/oclc/787843567&referer=brief_results)_, 29--60 (Chap 2: Enlightenment and Philosophical History).

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Reading reflection' text="
- What was new about Enlightenment thinking in general?
- In broad terms, how did Enlightenment thinking get applied to History?
- What were the commonalities and differences between the approaches to History described in the chapter?
"%}

{% include alert.html class='info' title='In class' text="
- Enlightenment philosophy of history
- Introduction to [Atom](https://atom.io/) and an optional, easier way to post your work.
- Walk through the [Connecting GitHub and Atom guide](http://fredgibbs.net/courses/etc/atom-and-github)
"%}



### 15: Romantic and Critical History
- Eileen Ka-May Cheng, _[Historiography](https://unm.worldcat.org/title/historiography-an-introductory-guide/oclc/787843567&referer=brief_results)_, 61--90 (Chap 3: Romantic and Critical History).
- Wilhelm von Humboldt, "On the Historian's Task" (1821). Read for the general characterization of history and what historians should be doing. There are some **long** sentences here that can be hard to follow, but just keep reading!

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Reading reflection' text="
- What would you say are the key differences between Romantic and Critical history?
- Give a few examples from von Humboldt's article that illustrate characterizations of history that appear in Cheng's chapter. What's most interesting to you about this description of a historian's task?
"%}



## Week 5

### 20: Review so far
- No new reading for today. Instead, you need to do one, longer synthetic reflection on what we've covered so far as a way of tying everything together and preparing for the Wednesday reading and reflection.

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='BIG reflection' text="
Write a ~1000 word reflection on the continuities and discontinuities in historical thinking and writing so far. Be sure to provide some SPECIFIC examples that are representative of the point you are trying to make. Also, include 1-2 big picture questions that we should address in class. These are due by 10am like all other reflections, and we'll be discussing everyone's thoughts and questions in class.

#### Pro tips
- Be careful of using words like truth, objective, fact, progress, better, etc. I don't mean that you _shouldn't_ use them, but that they should be used deliberately and carefully and with nuance that our readings have collectively given us.
- You know all those posts in our GitHub Repository? They are a great way to review the material, especially since y'all tend to have great ideas and different perspectives.
- This review is a great time to do some thinking about what you'd like to write about for _Metahistory_. Keep an eye out for people, topics, themes, ideas, etc, that you might want to learn more about and explain to a general audience.
"%}


### 22: Postmodern History
- Eileen Ka-May Cheng, _[Historiography](https://libproxy.unm.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=nlebk&AN=450949&site=ehost-live&scope=site)_, 112--132 (Chap 5: Social History, Fragmentation, and the Revival of Narrative).
- Skim super fast: Michel Foucault, _Archeology of Knowledge_, 3-17; 21-30; 31-39. What's the main point here? How does it illustrate what Cheng is talking about?

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Reading reflection' text="
Two rather contradictory questions for today that I hope encourage you to think about BOTH continuities and discontinuities, as you did for the review assignment.
- How does postmodern history constitute a fundamental historiographical paradigm shift?
- Why should we see postmodern changes in historical practice as more evolutionary than revolutionary?
"%}



## Week 6

### 27: Gender Histories
- Joan Scott, "Gender: A Useful Category of Historical Analysis", 1053-1075.
This is a classic article, meaning it is recognized has having helped make a real difference in the practice of history (and frequently read in classes like ours). Precisely because of its success, it seems a bit dated now. But it still makes a number of useful points that are still relevant, and it is a perfect example of how historians can directly shape the way history is written.

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Reading reflection' text="
Many students assume this article is trying to argue that historians should pay more attention to the role women in history. The article agrees, but the main point is actually much more interesting and nuanced. What is it?
"%}


### 29: Postcolonial Histories
- Dipesh Chakrabarty, "Postcoloniality and the Artifice of History: Who Speaks for 'Indian' Pasts?", 1-27. Skim (but don't skip) section IV (11--17).
This is another classic article that can also feel a bit out of date, yet another example of how historians can directly shape historiography by asking profound questions and offering new perspectives that were too easily unnoticed or ignored.

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Reading reflection' text="
 What is the premise of postcoloniality as described here? What are the main challenges to a postcolonial history?
"%}



## Week 7

### 4: Archival Power
- Joan M. Schwartz and Terry Cook, ‚ÄúArchives, Records and Power: The Making of Modern Memory,‚Äù 1‚Äì19. This article is a little repetitive at times, but in a good way, as it makes it easy to understand the main points. It is shorter than it looks in terms of page count because many pages are almost entirely footnotes (which you can peruse if you're interested).


{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Reading reflection' text="
- We've talked about the difficulties of objectivity and truth in history, and this article explains how archives are far from a neutral site of data-gathering. How and why are archives distorted?
- Given that they are the basis for history, is it possible for a historian using archives to be accurate in terms of reporting about the past?
- We typically think of archives as in the background, but why should they be considered active shapers of society?
"%}


### 6: Archival Silence
- Rodney G. S. Carter, ‚ÄúOf Things Said and Unsaid: Power, Archival Silences, and Power in Silence‚Äù _Archivaria_, September 25, 2006, 215‚Äì33.

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Reading reflection' text="
- Softball question as we wind up the first half: What ideas in the article were most and least interesting to you?
"%}



## Week 8

### 11 & 13: NO CLASS: Enjoy Fall Break!!!

{% include alert.html class='info' title='Thanks!' text="
Everyone has done a great job posting thoughtful reflections and contributing to invigorating discussions for this first half. The course is infinitely more interesting when everyone is putting in the work and sharing their perspectives, and that's clearly the case this semester. Thank you for your effort over the first half and I look forward to y'all keeping the bar high for the second half. You've earned a real fall break and a chance to recharge before diving into our _Historical Theory_ book. Have a great break and good luck with everything in the meantime.
"%}


{% include alert.html class='warning' title='Read ahead!' text="
It's a busy and tiring week (although not for this class), but the long weekend is a great time to get a jump on our book and reduce what you have to do on Sunday night (_when you won't want to do anything_). Obviously there is a chunk of reading for Monday, but any additional reading you can do before the semester resumes will make life much easier once it does.
"%}


## Week 9
This week we're starting our one book for the course. It's can be a bit theoretical and abstract at times (much of the time, TBH), but that challenge for us _is by design_. There will be paragraphs where you will be confused about what the author is trying to say. It's true for me, too! Don't be discouraged if you feel you're not "getting it". It's not easy and it's not meant to be. There are many names of historians that appear---some we've read about, some were merely mentioned, and some are totally new. Don't worry about specific names, but do understand the historiographical perspective they are meant to represent.

We'll work through the main points in our discussion. I think you'll agree that once we do, you'll have powerful new tools for interpreting not only history, but any kind of text (and everything is a text, as we now know). One of the aims of the course is that you can think abstractly about key issues in history and **broaden your ability to think abstractly about ANYthing**. That's what senior-level capstone seminars should do, in my opinion.


### 18: _Historical Theory_ I
- _Historical Theory_, 3--11 (Ch. 1: Introduction).
- _Historical Theory_, 12--30 (Ch. 2: The Contested Nature of Historical Knowledge).
- _Historical Theory_, 31--50 (Ch. 3: Historical Paradigms and Theoretical Traditions).

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Reading reflection' text="
Since we're reading distinct chapters and more pages than usual per meeting, it may be easier to have specific goals in mind for each chapter rather than as a whole. I'm trying to balance specific and general prompts per our last discussion, so here are some questions to keep in mind, but feel free to go off script as long as you're still showing me the engagement with the chapters.

- 1: There's a lot of postmodernism summary from the last few weeks here. What have we seen before that was useful to have recapped? Did it clarify anything that was still a bit murky in your mind? What in this chapter was new from what we've covered so far?

- 2: What is an \"empirical\" approach to history, and what does it presuppose about historical knowledge (and method)? What is the \"postmodernist challenge\" (as Fulbrook puts it) to history? How have postmodern critics and proponents alike failed to reconcile these (there is a distinct answer for each group)?

- 3: What is a paradigm as far as historians are concerned? Briefly (but not too briefly) summarize the different kinds of paradigms Fulbrook identifies (Implicit, Perspectival, Proper, Pidgin). Most importantly: why are paradigms so important for Fulbrook?
"%}


### 20: _Historical Theory_ II
- _Historical Theory_, 53--73 (Ch. 4: Beyond Metanarrative: Plots, Puzzles, and Plausibility).

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Reading reflection' text="
- Regarding the \"death of metanarrative\": What does Fulbrook mean by metanarrative? Why is it dead? Why does it matter?
- Why does Fulbrook disagree with Jenkins? How does she refute his claim that history is essentially fiction?
- Fulbrook says that historians are really just trying to solve puzzles. What puzzle is she trying to solve?
"%}


## Week 10

### 25: _Historical Theory_ III
- _Historical Theory_, 74--89; 94--97 (Ch. 5: Labelling the Parts: Categories and Concepts). We're skipping the section on Ideal Types because I find it unnecessarily confusing and not essential to the rest of the chapter.
- _Historical Theory_, 98--121 (Ch. 6: Looking for Clues).

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Reading reflection' text="
For EACH chapter (so your reflection will have 2 distinct parts, and multiple paragraphs within each part), \"essentialize\" what Fulbrook is arguing without cutting out all the nuance. In other words, the challenge here is to generalize without over generalizing. Describe theoretical problem she presents, the different sides of the debate, and her resolution of the problem. Your reflection will be a little longer than normal to do this effectively, but as consolation there is no reflection due for Wednesday.

Work assured that based on these difficult chapters, there is a LOT of room for interpretation, so there is no \"correct\" way of describing what she's saying.
"%}



### 27: _Historical Theory_ IV
- _Historical Theory_, 122--140 (Ch. 7: Satisfying Curiosity).

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Reading quiz' text="
**No reading reflection due today!** Instead, we're going to have a reading quiz IN CLASS. With real paper. It's going to be fun. Study up!
"%}



## Week 11

### 1: _Historical Theory_ V
- _Historical Theory_, 143--163 (Ch. 8: Representing the Past).
- _Historical Theory_, 164--184 (Ch. 9: History and Partisanship).


### 3: _Historical Theory_ VI
- _Historical Theory_, 185--196 (Ch. 10: Conclusion).
- Peruse [Metahistory](https://unm-historiography.github.io/metahistory/) again to remind yourself of the essays, their style, strengths, and weaknesses. Pick an essay you want to EDIT according to the [Metahistory guide](metahistory-guide), which is a guide to WRITING essays that you will use for your own, but also tells you what to look for when EDITING.

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Book reflection' text="
- What did you think of _Historical Theory_? How was it most useful? Where was it too confusing? What questions did it leave unanswered? How might we have prepared for or approached the book differently?
"%}

{% include alert.html class='info' title='In class' text="
- _Historical Theory_ Wrap up discussion
- _Metahistory_ revision assignments and editing instructions
"%}



## Week 12
### 8: _Metahistory_ Review and Historiographical Research Methods
- No new reading

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Essay revisions due' text="
- Carefully follow the directions for [setting up your _Metahistory_ repository](metahistory-setup).
- Carefully follow the directions for [revising _Metahistory_](metahistory-revisions). This exercise walks you through the process of making and publishing changes.
- As you revise, make sure you are referring to the checklist on [_Metahistory_ guide](metahistory-guide).
- After you finish your revisions, commit them to your repository, and create a pull request for your edits. This is _exactly_ the same process you followed for the test edit.
"%}

{% include alert.html class='info' title='In class' text="
What questions do we need to be asking to make _Metahistory_ most usable for students learning the basics of historiography?
- What are the strengths and weaknesses of the essay you edited?
"%}



### 10: Public History + Historiographical Research

{% include alert.html class='info' title='In class' text="
- Challenges and necessity of public history
- Basic research process that you should use for your essays. This ensures you will be selecting appropriate sources, and using and citing them appropriately.
"%}

{% include alert.html class='warning' title='Don\'t procrastinate with citations!' text="
If you just write stuff down and don't bother citing where you found it, you will have to eventually hunt down all the page numbers and THAT'S A HUGE WASTE OF TIME. As someone who has wasted considerable time on just that, please take my advice: take time to make accurate references AS YOU WRITE.
"%}



## Week 13

### 15: History as Data
- SKIM: Margo Anderson, "Quantitative History", 246-59.
- Laura Spinney, [History as a giant data set: how analysing the past could help save the future](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/nov/12/history-as-a-giant-data-set-how-analysing-the-past-could-help-save-the-future)

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Reading Reflection' text="
  - Is quantitative history fundamentally different from 'regular' history?
  - To what extent will all history gradually become quantitative history (as sources are born-digital or become digitized)?  
  - How does this suggestion problem solving through history conflict with uses of history as we've seen them so far in the course?
"%}


### 17: Digital History
- No new readings, but you need to post your annotated bibliographies to GitHub for class discussion

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Annotated Bibliographies Due' text="
Your bibliographies should include a minimum of 10 sources relevant to your topic. You should aim for a range of both very specific and broader sources. They should be published in the last 20 years, unless you are citing a \"classic\" work.
"%}

{% include alert.html class='info' title='In class' text="
Presentation on Digital History Projects: Past, Present, and Future
"%}



## Week 14
### 22: TBD

### 24: NO CLASS: Happy Thanksgiving!
{% include alert.html class='danger' title='COMPLETE Drafts Due' text="
No class today, but you must post by the end of the day a COMPLETE draft for your essay, which should be around at least 2000 words (with the final being 2500). With no reading assignment, this is obviously your focus, so DO IT WELL and save everyone (including your future self) headaches later.

'Draft' does not mean some half-baked sketch hastily thrown together so you have something to post. It means a COMPLETE FIRST VERSION that we can all respond to in a meaningful way. If your post is too hastily thrown together, you will need to revise and resubmit it immediately to get credit for completing the assignment.

Your essays will undergo peer review over the weekend, so you should have a **TOTALLY COMPLETE** and REASONABLY POLISHED draft following the [writing guide](https://unm-historiography.github.io/intro-guide/writing-guide).
"%}



## Week 15

### 29: NO CLASS: Happy Post-Thanksgiving!
- Find your essay review assignments for Wednesday's assignment HERE (link TBP).


### 1: Reader Reports
- No new readings. Today we read through and go over reader reports and general revision strategies.

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Reader Reports Due' text="
Bring your TWO ~500 word critiques on TWO different essays. Review assignments are posted [in our repository](https://github.com/unm-historiography/2021-fall/blob/master/review-assignments.md). Focus on the big picture: framing, historiographical significance, and accessibility for the intended audience. As you did for the previous critique, be sure you are thinking about and addressing what's in the [writing guide](metahistory-guide).
"%}



## Week 16
### 6: Publishing your essay
- No new readings.

{% include alert.html class='info' title='In class' text="
- Review the steps necessary to publish your essay on the official _Metahistory_ site. This process is basically the same as when you committed your revisions a few weeks ago. There are a few additional concerns since you're making a NEW essay this time. Your final version must be posted by December 13.
"%}



### 8: Last questions/comments and course wrap up
- No new readings.

{% include alert.html class='info' title='In class' text="
