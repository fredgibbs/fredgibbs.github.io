# IN PROGRESS!
This syllabus is a guide, not a contract. As a living document that changes depending on how things are going, you'll want to bookmark and consult the online version of this syllabus frequently. Important links to online assignment guides and other instructions will appear throughout the course, and I will always announce important changes in class. No significant changes will be made to the overall workload. If you print out the syllabus, be sure you keep your paper version up to date with the online version.

"%}


## Week 2

### 26: Philosophy of History
- _PoH_, 1-13.
{% include alert.html class='info' title='Leave time for GitHub' text="
A short reading assignment, partially to let you get used to posting on GitHub. Everyone should post a comment on the following, drawing from the previous two readings and your own personal experience:
- What is history for?
- What's the difference between studying the philosophy of history and historiography?
- How is historiography useful outside of the academy?
"%}

### 28: Pre-classical History + Greco-Roman History
- _PoH_,  14-27; 28-44.


## Week 3

### 2: NO CLASS (Labor Day)

### 4: Medieval History
* _PoH_, 45-73.  



## Week 4

### 9: Early Modern Historiographical Revolutions
- _PoH_, 74-106.
- Niccolò Machiavelli, _The Prince_, 5-19. (These are really small pages.) Everyone should come to class prepared to discuss: What examples from _The Prince_ illustrate what's in the chapter? How does it draw from previous historiographic traditions?

{% include alert.html class='info' title='Review posts from last time' text="
We're going to tie up some loose ends from last time, so we can be most efficient if you review the excellent questions and comments you produced for last Wednesday's class.
"%}

### 11: Interlude?
- _PoH_, 107-126.
- Discussion of [Intro Guide](https://unm-historiography.github.io/intro-guide/) assignment due Monday.


## Week 5

### 16: Giambattista Vico (1668-1744)
- _PoH_, 127-167. Skim 137-160. You should still read these pages---they are actually quite interesting as perhaps the first comprehensive theory of history---but read quickly as to not get bogged down in the details.

{% include alert.html class='info' title='The Intro Guide' text="

**As you look over the intro guide, stay out of the weeds!** Really specific criticism about a particular essay is not particularly helpful at this stage. Keep your analysis focused on the big picture and the overall project.

Maintaining our four groups:
- **Questioners**: What questions to we need to be asking of ourselves to make this most usable for an early college student? These should be a product of surveying what's already in the guide and thinking about what should or should not be in it as well as how it should be done.
- **Summarizers**: What are the strengths and weaknesses of what's already here and what you find to be lacking?
- **Commenters**: Can early college students learn the BASICS of historiography from this KIND of resource? Don't limit your analysis simply to what is already on the site. What should the key features be? Can such a guide be a way of helping students to reimagine what history is?
- **Slackers**: You don't need to write anything, but as always be ready to contribute to our conversation.

Note: There is an overwhelming amount to be improved, so the assignment here is to some extent an exercise in stating the obvious---but it's an important first step. You will be graded on your effort to say something productive and improve the project.
"%}

### 18: Enlightenment
- _PoH_, 168-200.
- Discussion of editing assignment due next week


## Week 6

### 23: Hegel
- _PoH_, 201-237.

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='First edits due' text="
Consult the [Intro-guide revision guidelines](1st-revision-guide).

You can access the intro guide (I'm now calling it _Metahistory_ just for fun) [here](https://unm-historiography.github.io/intro-guide/).

Your first edits should be complete and visible on GitHub. Note that changes will be made in the [intro guide repository](https://github.com/unm-historiography/intro-guide), which is separate from the repository for our reading responses. We'll devote some class discussion time for evaluating these. There is nothing else to post for today, BUT:

Be prepared to discuss what’s significant with Hegel, what’s new with his view of history, and why should we care. There is a very high probability of me using the cards to keep everyone honest.

Remember that the first chunk (up to p. 213 or so) is an overview of his philosophy that you should read quickly. Slow down when it's more about his theory of history.
"%}

### 25: Marx
- _PoH_, 238-277.

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Image edits due' text="
We looked at the code page in class, but I split off the images stuff into their own file with more explicit directions for Wednesday. See [Embedding images in your essays](https://unm-historiography.github.io/intro-guide/loading-images).

The original [code samples](https://unm-historiography.github.io/intro-guide/code) are still available.

All you need to do is copy and paste the code from the gray box, and change the parameters (position, width, filename, etc).

- BE CAREFUL ABOUT QUOTATIONS! If you accidentally omit a quotation mark, the code won't work and the whole site will break.

- If you ever get an email or notification of a 'Page Build Failure', send me a quick email to let me know and I will look at what's wrong. There's a chance it's not with your file, so if you don't see anything wrong, just keep working and it will get resolved.

- If you get really confused or frustrated, relax. We'll work through issues on Wednesday and you can finish uploading code and images before Monday.
"%}

{% include alert.html class='info' title='postmodernism so far' text="
Write a comment (400-500 words) about your take on postmodern history. Write/focus on whatever you like, but provide at least rough answers to the following kinds of questions: how have our readings affected the way you think about history? Does postmodern history constitute a historiographical paradigm shift? In other words: Are late twentieth-century ways of writing about history that we've discussed a 'rupture' from previous historiographies? Or are they more on a continuum of historiographical change. Be interesting.
"%}



## Week 11

### 28: Discursive History
* Foucault, _Archeology of Knowledge_, 21-39.

{% include alert.html class='info' title='WTF' text="
Everyone is a commenter for today, and you need to answer two questions to which you should devote roughly equal space:
1. Translate Foucault's main points (readers choice!) into clear and concise language.
2. What did you find most interesting about the selections, **and Why**? Note that what you found most interesting may or may not be what you consider the main point.
"%}

### 30:  Getting to the know the Intro Guide
{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Revisions due' text="
Be sure all edits are committed to GitHub.
"%}


## Week 12
### 4: Essay Outlines
{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Essay Outlines' text="
For today, post a COMPLETE outline for your essay. With no reading assignment, this is obviously your focus, so DO IT WELL and save everyone (including your future self) headaches later.

Your outline will be gradually expanded into your essay, so the better the topic points--WHICH WILL BECOME PARAGRAPHS LATER--the easier time you will have shifting your essay from topics (ideas) into prose (narrative).

Your topic points should include the crucial explanations for what's significant about what you're talking about--especially how it deviated from previous historiography at the time and its legacy.

Put your outlines in the [essays/outlines folder](https://github.com/unm-historiography/2019-fall/tree/master/essays/outlines)

### START BUILDING YOUR ZOTERO LIBRARY
For more instructions on what to do, [watch this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD8_6MZFI8c&feature=youtu.be).

### THESE ARE WORKING NOTES
As such, ask questions, makes notes to yourself and your colleagues (who will review your work later).

### DON'T FORGET CITATIONS
If you just write stuff down and don't bother citing where you found it, you will have to eventually hunt down all the page numbers and THAT'S A HUGE WASTE OF TIME. As someone who has wasted considerable time on just that, please take my advice: take time to make accurate references THE FIRST TIME.
"%}

### 6: Narrative history
- Alex Rosenberg, [Why most narrative history is wrong](https://www.salon.com/2018/10/07/why-most-narrative-history-is-wrong/)

"%}



## Week 13

### 11:
{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Expand Topic Points ' text="
Two steps for this assignment:

1) Improve your topic points according to feedback

2) Make them paragraphs (add/delete/combine as need be)

#### Be sure your paragraphs have an expressed purpose, contribute to your argument, and cite adequate sources.

"%}
### 13: Scales of history
* Kieran Healy, "Fuck nuance", 1-13.

{% include alert.html class='info' title='Discussion prep' text="
  - Besides making for a good story, is there significant value in historical work that simply adds nuance to widely accepted understandings of the past?
