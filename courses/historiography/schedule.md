# IN PROGRESS!
This syllabus is a guide, not a contract. As a living document that changes frequently depending on what's going on with our group, you'll want to bookmark and consult the online version of this syllabus frequently. Important links to online assignment guides and other instructions will appear throughout the course, and I will always announce important changes in class. No significant changes will be made to the overall workload. If you print out the syllabus, be sure you keep your paper version up to date with the online version.

## 2: Historiographical Introductions

### 22: What is Historiography?
{% include alert.html class='warning' title='Leave time for GitHub' text="
* All assignments must be posted in [our repository](https://github.com/unm-historiography/2018-spring). Instructions are in the [README file](https://github.com/unm-historiography/2018-spring/blob/master/README.md).
"%}

## 3: Premodern History

### 29: Ancient History
{% include alert.html class='warning' title='Preparing for Multiple Readings' text="

When there are multiple readings paired together like today, treat the readings as a whole in your preparatory assignment (whichever group you're in). There's no need to divide up your summaries/questions/comments strictly by the two selections. You can (probably should) make comments about each reading, but please feel free to have more or less to say about one or the other, depending on what you find most significant. You might also generalize about both at the same time. There certainly isn’t any rigid number of summary points or questions you need to have for each reading. Similarly, comments don’t have to give each reading equal space, but they should address elements of each reading.

More broadly, remember that each type of response should reflect your engagement with the entire assignment. So, if you don't say much of anything about one of the readings, it will be hard for me to know you spent any time with it.
"%}

* _FHTH_, 25-35.  
* _Faces of History_, "Roman foundations", 48-69. Don't get lost in the copious detail provided (skim when necessary). But do think about how much this description of Roman history supports or contradicts the much more condensed version from _FHTH_---and feel free to write about it in your posts.

### 31: Medieval History
* _FHTH_, 35-45.  
* _Faces of History_, "History in the medieval mirror", 99-124. Ditto from last time.



## 4: Historiographical Revolutions

### 5: Early Modern Historiographical Revolutions
* _FHTH_, "The historiographical revolution of the early modern era", 47-67.
* Niccolò Machiavelli, _The Prince_, 5-19. (These are really small pages.) As a primary source, don't worry about integrating Machiavelli into your responses---focus on _FHTH_. However, everyone should come to class prepared to discuss: How does Machiavelli use history in his text? How does it draw from previous historiographic traditions?


### 7: Historical Professionalization
* _FHTH_, "The 19th century and the rise of academic scholarship", 68-96.  
* Thomas Gil, "Leopold Ranke", 383-92.




## 5: Scientific History

### 12: Historiography in the Early 20th Century
* _FHTH_, "Scientific history in an era of conflict", 97-124.

### 14: The _Annales_ School
* _Houses_, "The _Annales_", 87-109.   



## 6: Marxist / Sociological History

### 19: Marx and History
* Tom Rockmore, "Marx", 488-96.
* _Houses_, "Marxist Historians", 33-58.

### 21: Sociology
* _Houses_, "Historical sociology", 110-140.   

{% include alert.html class='warning' title='New Comment Assignment' text="

- For today (as last time), everyone will write a comment-type post that addresses the following questions: What are the crucial differences between history and sociology? What are the strengths and weaknesses of each? Is it possible to combine them, or are they incompatible systems? How does the excerpt in _Houses_ for this week provide any insight into these questions?

- You don't have to give each question equal attention (you might prefer to focus on one or two), but be sure that you at least touch on each question.

- Remember, don't make your thesis too vague, like 'history and sociology are different.' In this case, you should make a more specific argument about _how_ they are different. Of course, you can argue whatever you want.

- Lastly, as much as you can, draw in previous readings and historiographical ideas to support your argument. Now that we've got a few weeks of readings under our belts, such synthetic work is now required for top scores on your assignments.
"%}



## 7: (post)Modern Histories

### 26: A 20th-century overview
* _FHTH_, "Glorious Confusion", 127-65.
{% include alert.html class='warning' title='New Summary Assignment' text="

- For today, everyone will write a summary post (of the whirlwind Popkin chapter) that highlights the key historiographical changes in the second half of the 20th century. Be comprehensive (as a good summary is) AND selective (as a good summary is).

- Explain very briefly (as you have been doing in summaries previously), **why and how** the change is significant. Unlike last time, you DO NOT need to explicitly cite previous readings, but when you're explaining why something is significant, you'll do well to mention how it's deviating from historiographical tradition.

- Its very important to keep your writing both informal and sharp! (he he)
"%}


### 28: Quantitative History
* _Houses_, "Quantitative History", 141-50; skim 151-71.
* Margo Anderson, "Qualitative History", 246-59.

{% include alert.html class='warning' title='Discussion prep' text="

- Come to class prepared to discuss whether quantitative history has a more rosy future (as claimed on p. 258) in 2018 than it did in 2007 (when Outwaite was writing) or in 1967 (after initial forays into cliometrics).

- **There is nothing to post for today, but BE SURE you are ready to contribute to class discussion.**

"%}



## 8: Micro/Macro Histories

### 5: Historical Scales
* Georg Iggers, "From Macro- to Microhistory: The History of Everyday Life", 101-117.
* _Houses_, "Anthropology and ethnohistorians", 172-203.

{% include alert.html class='warning' title='Questions Abound' text="

- Everyone is the question group for today.
- Prepare a set of questions (per usual question guidelines) that explores the historiographical precedents for (and therefore the novelty of) macrohistory and ethnohistories (not that they are the same thing) as developed in the later 20th century.
- **You should draw and cite from previous readings.**
"%}


### 7: Historical Significance
* Kieran Healy, "Fuck nuance", 1-13.
* Langdon Winner, "Do artifacts have politics?", 121-35.

{% include alert.html class='warning' title='Discussion prep' text="

- Come to class prepared to discuss the following two questions (one from each reading):
  - Besides making for a good story, is there significant value in historical work that simply adds nuance to widely accepted understandings of the past?
  - Can history can really be about artifacts rather than the people that make them or are affected by them?
- **There is nothing to post for today, but BE SURE you are ready to contribute to class discussion.**

"%}



## 9: Spring Break (12 + 14)



## 10: De-centerings

### 19: Intro to Postmodernism
* _Houses_, "The challenge of postmodernism/poststructuralism", 297-306; 308-25.

{% include alert.html class='warning' title='Glorious Revisions' text="

- Review everyone else's summaries posted for February 26th. Pay attention to bullet length, formatting, how ideas are described and paraphrased, citations, etc.
- REVISE your own summary to improve any aspect you find lacking (add points important points you missed, tighten prose, improve formatting, etc)
- ADD 1-3 bullets at the end that describe your changes.
- Everyone should have a 10 at this point; make sure you can justify that your summary is as good as anyone's.
- There is nothing to post specifically on the readings for today, but BE SURE you are ready to discuss how the historiographical changes in your summaries reflect the notion of postmodernism.**
