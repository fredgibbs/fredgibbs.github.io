#_Metahistory_ Addition Guide

This guide is useful ONLY AFTER you have followed the directions for [setting up your _Metahistory_ repository](metahistory-setup) AND have done some [_Metahistory_ revisions](metahistory-revisions).

Before proceeding, make sure you have your own copy of the _Metahistory_ repository, and you can see the functioning website based on YOUR repository in YOUR GitHub account (the URL will look like https://github.com/USERNAME/metahistory/).

### Save time with bookmarks
Create bookmarks in your browser for two locations you will be visiting often:
- YOUR own _Metahistory_ REPOSITORY: https://github.com/USERNAME/metahistory/, replacing USERNAME with your GitHub username.
- YOUR own _Metahistory_ WEBSITE: https://USERNAME.github.io/metahistory

## Grab the sample page
- Similar to what you did when getting your page for revisions, grab the raw code for the [sample essay])https://github.com/unm-historiography/2021-fall/blob/main/metahistory-sample.md).
- Working in YOUR repository (the URL will look like https://github.com/USERNAME/metahistory/), go into the `essays` folder **and appropriate subfolder for the time period or theme of your essay.**
- Create a new page for your essay the same way you create posts for your reading responses.
- Paste in the code from the [sample essay])https://github.com/unm-historiography/2021-fall/blob/main/metahistory-sample.md).
- Edit the header of your file (the metadata between the `---` marks at the top) to reflect your TITLE, SUBTITLE, NAME.
- Also add one of the following to the `toc-section` field:
  - antiquity
  - medieval
  - early-modern
  - enlightenment
  - modern
  - postmodern
  - thematic
- Commit your new page.


## Test your page
- Remember there is a short lag between when you commit your file and when those changes appear on the actual webpage.
- Test your page by going to https://USERNAME.github.io/metahistory (you bookmarked it, right?) and navigate to the page you edited.
- If your page is not showing up in the table of contents, check the `toc-section` field. You can still get to your essay at: https://USERNAME.github.io/metahistory/essays/FOLDER/FILENAME, where FOLDER is the folder in which you created a new file, and FILENAME is the name of the file you edited.
- **You need to have your essay publicly accessible to participate in the peer review process!**


## Page build errors
If you commit a file with a syntax error (a missing quote or something like that), you will get an email saying there is a "page build error". Until you fix it, you won't see any subsequent changes you save on your online version.
