# Setting up your OWN _Metahistory_ work environment


## Fork the intro-guide repository.
Go to the [intro-guide repository](https://github.com/unm-historiography/metahistory), and click the `Fork` button in the upper right corner (don't click the number).
- You'll see a popup window asking you where you want to fork it, and you'll click on your username (you should only have one choice).
- Notice where you are! You are looking at the intro-guide repository under YOUR OWN ACCOUNT. This is evident from the URL and the top left of the GitHub page. Our collection will always have `unm-historiography` in it, and yours will have your GitHub username. But the list of files looks exactly the same (they are!), so be careful!

## Enable your website
- Under the settings tab, scroll down to the `GitHub Pages` section (second from the bottom), and under `source`, change it from `none` to `master branch`. Scroll back down to the GitHub Pages section, and notice that it gives you a URL for your version of the intro-guide. It will look like https://USERNAME.github.io/metahistory.
- Working in YOUR repository (which will look like https://github.com/USERNAME/metahistory/), go into the `essays` folder and appropriate subfolder, and create a new page for your essay the same way you create posts for your reading responses.
- Copy and paste the standard page header from the Code Examples page or copy the code from an existing page.
- Copy and paste image code from the Loading Images page or copy code from an existing page. You want to get one image to appear, just to make sure you have working code for it.
- Write a 1-2 paragraph abstract of what you'd intend to do in your essay. This is a starting point, not a final commitment, but be thorough.

## Test your page
- You can test your page by going to https://USERNAME.github.io/metahistory/essays/FOLDER/FILENAME, where FOLDER is the folder in which you created a new file, and FILENAME is the name of your file.
- Get your page looking like you want within YOUR repository. If you commit a file with a syntax error (a missing quote or something like that), you will get an email saying there is a page build error. Until you fix it, you won't see any subsequent changes you save on your online version.

- You're done! You can now commit all changes to your own file in your repository and see how they look online. Just remember there is a few minutes lag between when you save your file and when those changes appear on the actual webpage.
