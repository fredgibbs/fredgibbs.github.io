- MW 12:00 -- 1:15
- 3 Credit Hours
- Prof. Fred Gibbs \([fwgibbs@unm.edu](mailto:fwgibbs@unm.edu)\) @ 1077 Mesa Vista Hall
- Student Hours: MW 9:30--10:30, right after class, and by appointment if necessary

## Course Description
Historiography literally means the writing of history. This class, then, introduces some of the most influential approaches that historians (from antiquity through the present) have taken in writing about the past. Our survey also identifies and discusses some philosophies of history (the underlying assumptions of how we can access and understand the past), as well as various historical interpretive frameworks that have shaped historical writing. It focuses, however, on various meta-questions about history: **What is history? What is it for? Who is it for?**


## Student Learning Outcomes (SLOs)
* Compare and contrast different processes, modes of thought, and modes of expression from different historical time periods.

* Explain how and why historians have argued about philosophical and methodological approaches to their craft over time, and what cultural changes precipitated new views.

* Recognize and articulate the diversity of human experience, including ethnicity, gender, language, as well as political, economic, social, and cultural structures over time and space---and how that is reflected in historical writing.


## General Expectations
* As an undergraduate seminar, active engagement is crucial to (y)our success. Simply showing up to class counts for very little; I expect that you'll actively participate in all discussions. If you are shy about speaking in class, don't worry. You will become much more comfortable and fluent by the end of the semester. It is an essential skill that much be practiced, and this is the perfect place to do so. Please come see me if you'd like to discuss how we can make it easier for you to jump into the discussion. To ensure the discussion isn't dominated by the most outgoing students, I will call on people who aren't speaking up. The point isn't just to put people on the spot and create anxiety, but to help everyone hear as many perspectives as possible. Diversity of opinions and viewpoints is a key feature of this course. Please be prepared to contribute!

* You cannot make up missed classes. Please DO NOT email me asking if you missed anything, or what you missed, or how to make it up (yes, everything, and you can't are the respective answers). Feel free to ask your class colleagues for notes. Emergencies beyond your control are the one exception to the attendance policy, and you should let me know about these ASAP.

* Our room is quite small and coming in late is a huge disruption. I get that weird random things happen that might make you a little late once or twice. Repeatedly being late will negatively impact your grade.

* If you run into personal problems during the semester that make school difficult for you, PLEASE talk to me about what adjustments we can make to help you succeed in the course.


## Work Requirements and Grading
Although I do not calculate grades strictly mathematically, I have provided percentages to indicate how much relative weight each component of the course receives in my evaluation of student performance.

- **Active and thoughtful participation in class discussions** (30%)

  - Because most of your participation in this course is not assigned a specific letter grade (and because many intangible factors go into a grade), what follows is my functional approach to evaluating your participation in this course. Basically, everyone starts with a B, and you gradually move it up or down depending on the consistency and quality of your class participation. If you are contributing to discussion most days, but aren't really adding anything new, but are clearly making an effort to stay involved, you stay at a B. If you are generally contributing to discussion but occasionally have insights to share or a good question, your grade moves to a B+. If you are generally asking good questions and highlighting important points from the readings on a regular basis, your grade moves to A-. If you are also actively engaging in the conversation each day and your comments are clearly based on the readings (not just your opinion at the time), your grade moves to an A. Conversely, you can also move your grade down by hardly ever participating in class, or making consistently superficial comments. Not showing up lowers your grade very quickly. I assign a final participation grade at the end of the course, not for each class meeting.

- **Preparation work for each class** (30%)

  - Everyone will post a ~400-word critical comment on the readings. These should be high quality but informal writing, like you were writing for a literary magazine. Have an opinion, a specific point to make, and have fun writing about it. Resist the urge to just summarize the readings---we're all reading the same thing.

  - **All posts are due by 9am the day of class.** I use these posts to guide our discussion plan for our meetings, so these need to be posted at least very close to on time. Don't get anxious over the EXACT time---a few minutes or even 15 minutes late is fine. But posting after 10am is definitely too late. Consistently late posts will negatively impact your grade.

  - As part of your response, include 1 or 2 questions (or more, if you have them) that will help guide discussion for that class. Don't ask questions that actually have an obvious factual answer, but questions that help us think critically about the readings. Was there something that seemed to make no sense? Or something you totally disagreed with? Or a seemingly interesting point that wasn't explained very well? Coming up with good questions is much harder than it sounds, which is why it's good to practice it.

- These posts are not specifically graded, but are evaluated in the same way as class participation. I routinely highlight excellent reflections, and I sometimes highlight posts that are generally good but lacking in an easily fixable way. This is how I hold you accountable  for your work. I will let you know if your posts are consistently falling short of expectations and thus impacting your grade. If you'd like more feedback on them, you need to ask for it.

- **Historiographical Essay** (25%)
Previous iterations of this course have created essays on historiographical topics for a lower-division historiography course. Each student will contribute revisions to an existing essay and create a new essay on a topic of their choice.


- [Final learning reflection](final-reflections) (15%)
This final essay allows you describe what you learned in the course as a way of boosting your final grade.


## Get feedback whenever you want
**Please talk to me about your grade at any time**, and as often as you'd like. Please do not email about this; a conversation is far more useful and efficient and avoids misunderstandings. Right before or after class is a good time, as well as office hours.


## Submitting Work
For various reasons I'll explain in class, you will post work on a non-UNM platform that we will ultimately use for the Historiographical Essays, which is at [https://github.com/unm-historiography/2019-fall](https://github.com/unm-historiography/2019-fall). We'll talk more about this in class, but instructions are [here](http://fredgibbs.net/courses/etc/github-instructions.html). This is a REQUIRED, not optional, way of submitting work.


## Required Readings
Although I have kept the reading load to a reasonable level (kind of low for an upper-level history course), some readings can quite dense and conceptually challenging. This emphasis on thinking and writing is by design, as a capstone course for the history department. Be honest with yourself about whether you have time to fit this course into your busy schedule. One of the goals of the course is that you will learn to read, absorb, and think critically about information more easily and quickly than you can already. That skill is hard-earned, and only comes with practice.

There is one required book for the course. It's at UNM Bookstore and you can find copies online. You can also rent an eBook through Amazon. I don't care what format you get, but we do read the whole book and it's an essential aspect of the course.

- To access all other articles and book chapters on the syllabus, you will need to subscribe to the course Zotero library. The URL for the group library is [https://www.zotero.org/groups/632527/historiography-unm/items](https://www.zotero.org/groups/632527/historiography-unm/items), but you must have clicked on the link in your invitation to access the library!

### Step 1: Create a Zotero account
If you don't have one already, [sign up for a free account at zotero.org](https://www.zotero.org/user/register). Creating a Zotero account requires only that you specify a username, password, and email address. You will not get any spam from Zotero or anyone else because of your Zotero account. **Use your UNM email address!!!!!**

### Step 2: Make sure you are logged in at zotero.org
You should see your username or a "Log Out" link on the top nav bar. If you see a "Log In" link, you need to log in. Pretty straightforward.

### Step 3: Request to Join our group library
Visit [our Zotero Group homepage](https://www.zotero.org/groups/632527/historiography-unm/), and click the red "Join" button off to the right, which will send an email to me. As soon as I see it (usually within the hour unless you're doing it late at night), I'll approve your request to join the group. There is nothing else you need to do at this point.


### ONCE CONNECTED: Accessing Readings
{% include alert.html class='info' title='' text="
Once you've completed the steps above, and I've approved your request to join our library, you can access our course readings most easily via [our Group Library page](https://www.zotero.org/groups/632527/historiography-unm/library). Double clicking an item brings up a PDF of the article or chapter.
