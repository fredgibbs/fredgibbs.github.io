#_Metahistory_ Writing Guide
_Metahistory_ is intended as an introductory guide to historiography in the form of essays on relevant historiographical topics.

Contributing an essay to the collection is not only an exercise in historiography but also an exercise in public history. Reducing a complicated set of ideas (as you know (or soon will), historiography can be an abstract subject that's hard to grasp at first) to their essence and presenting them to a general audience is a widely applicable skill in any career.

This writing guide is a basically a checklist of things to keep in mind while you're writing and especially revising, or during the peer review process.


## So What Question
Make sure the essay both very near the beginning and at the end makes it very clear what the reader is meant to take away as the main points. In other words, the essay needs to very obviously answer the SO WHAT question. Your essay probably already has a clear statement to this effect somewhere in the essay although it might not be worded clearly or concisely.

### Make sure the historiographical significance is clear throughout the essay

## General writing advice
- Have a clear idea of where the reader will be in terms of understanding your topic, and decide what will be useful for them (and what youâ€™re capable of doing), and plot the steps along the way.
- Give specific examples to illustrate your broader claims.
- Weed out the fluff! Remove extra words or sentences that don't really add anything new or serve a necessary purpose.FOCUSED PARAGRAPHS
- Focus your paragraphs: Paragraphs are visual representations of ideas, so each paragraph should have one main idea that is connected to what comes before and after it.


## Citations and bibliographies
- _Metahistory_ is meant to be a trusted academic resource. Historical summary or historiographical claims must include parenthetical citations to reputable sources with precise and unambiguous citations.
- The bibliography should include only those sources directly cited. If something is important, you will find a way to cite it.



## Readability
Improving accessibility of these essays for the average college student is our main goal. Try to revise any sentences that are too long, or too hard to follow. That said, we don't want overly simplistic writing, either. You don't have to write the perfect sentence (although that's always the goal)---just leave it better than you found it. Sometimes stepping back and rewriting a sentence or two and paraphrasing is the fastest way to improve clarity. Don't hesitate to replace prose to communicate more effectively.

Let's assume that potential readers are going to quickly skim the page to decide if it's worth reading. A few things can help draw readers in.

### Meaningful headings
Overly general or clever headings are usually more confusing than helpful and can be a turnoff. If you find a heading that is more a pun than a guide to the main concept in the section, revise it!

### First sentences
Informative first sentences in each paragraph helps give the reader a quick overview. If the gist of the essay isn't clear from just skimming the first sentences, there is room for improvement. The first or second sentence of each paragraph should make it clear what idea will be developed in the paragraph. Paragraphs are visual representations of ideas, so each paragraph should have one main idea connected to what comes before and after it.

### Paragraph lengths
There is nothing intrinsically wrong with long paragraphs, but long paragraphs are quite difficult to read on a screen, and are also rather off-putting to new readers confronted with a wall of text. It is often very easy to make one large paragraph into two or three without much or any additional editing.

### Attention to detail
Make sure your essay is free of typos, sentence fragments, and simple sentences. This makes it harder to read and calls your authority and trustworthiness into question. If you can't be bothered to write clear sentences, maybe you didn't do very good research, either.


### Be explicit
Every person, place, thing, concept mentioned in the essay should be there for a reason, and that reason should be explicitly spelled out. Make sure all people get a very brief introduction (even in passing); you should assume that readers don't know anyone you're talking about.

**Here's an example of expanding an important point that is way too compressed into something longer but much clearer.** Obviously you're not going to do this sort of thing for every sentence, but if you can do it for the most important points, future readers will get a lot more out of these guides---and come away with a very different perspective and appreciation of history!

### Before
Augustine's _City of God_ made history of human affairs seem less relevant because we are all simply living out God's preordained plan.

### After
[St. Augustine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustine_of_Hippo) (354--430), regarded as one of the most important Church fathers and early Christian theologians, suggested that the history of human affairs was less relevant than Biblical history because humans are simply living out God's preordained plan. This view emerges in part from his classic work [_City of God_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_City_of_God), written to show that Christianity was not responsible for the fall of Rome, and which emphasize how we are merely passing through the temporal and corrupt Earthly City on our way (with proper behavior) to the eternal and perfect City of God.

## Images
We all agreed that images make the essays WAY more interesting. Let's aim for 3--5 images per essay. If your essay doesn't have any, find some relevant images that you can freely use (from sites like [Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page)). If your essay has 1 or 2 already, think of some images you can use to supplement what's already there. Feel free to replace images that seem too far afield from the essay's topic.

### Image Captions
For all images (new or existing), make sure they have USEFUL captions that explicitly connect the image to the topic of the. Good captions might be two or three sentences long and make an important point that is fleshed out in the essay. Readers should be able to understand some of the most important points in your essay just by reading captions! And hopefully they will be intrigued enough to read the essay itself.

### Sensible typography
Most of the typography is standardized, but many essays have too much bold or italics. Remove anything that doesn't need to be there and/or is distracting. Sometimes bolded statements could be moved into a pull quote.

## Remove gratuitous links
Reading an essay with lots of links to external websites is distracting and generally unhelpful. People know how to search for what they want to learn more about.
