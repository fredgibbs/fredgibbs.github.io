# Reading Reflections

## Objective
**The main point of these reflections is to show your familiarity with the readings and make clear the work you have put into the course.** You do this by composing a thoughtful response to the prompt BASED ON THE READINGS. **There is no such thing as a "correct" answer---only more or less informed reflections.** You're being evaluated on how informed your reflections are. Make sure your reflection reflects your effort!

If there are a number of questions in the reflection prompt, you don't need to answer each question one by one, although you can always do that. But your reflection should be clearly related to the prompt, even if you go in a slightly different direction.

## Basics
- ~350 words **Remember longer responses that cover more material get extra points.**
- Coherent sentences with proper grammar, punctuation, capitalization
- Clearly and thoughtfully addresses topics/questions in the prompt
- Submitted on time via Canvas
- Differentiate yourself from AI

## Reflect more than summarize
Please resist the urge to simply summarize the readings. Of course answering questions in the prompt you'll end up restating and paraphrasing ideas that you want to address. That's important! But this exercise is NOT about just regurgitating the readings or identifying the "most" important points---everyone will learn something different from them. The goal is show me you can think critically about the questions USING THE SET OF READINGS!
