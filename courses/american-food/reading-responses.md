# Reading Responses

## Objective
There's almost always a prompt that asks a few related questions, and helps focus your attention on the readings, and you should answer them. HOWEVER, if you were really into the readings/topic and want to riff on a related theme, GO FOR IT! In either case, I'm interested learning in WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT THE IDEAS IN THE READINGS, not just in getting a summary of the readings.

## Basics
- ~300 words
- Original thinking
- Free of typos and basic grammatical errors
- Posted ON TIME at UNM Learn, meaning the day it appears on the syllabus.

## Questions to think about
- What ideas did you find most interesting?
- What was most unclear or confusing?
- What questions did they bring up?
- How did the reading(s) alter your thinking about food (or not)?
- What topics weren't addressed but should have been?
- How do the readings agree or disagree with each other?
- How do the readings overlap with previous readings?

## Reflect more than summarize
I'm much more interested in reading about YOUR PERSONAL LEARNING EXPERIENCE than reading a summary of the assignment. Of course in describing what you found most interesting or what you disagreed with the most you'll end up restating some ideas from the reading. That's important! But this exercise is NOT about just regurgitating the readings or identifying the "most" important points---everyone will learn something different from them.

## Grading
We use a consistent grading rubric for basic reading responses---and this should always be visible to you on Learn---but the criteria are basically:

**Familiarity**: Do you have a sense of what's in the SET of READINGS? Completely ignoring one or more of the readings in your post is the easiest way to lose points for this category.

**Clarity**: Can I understand what you're trying to say? This includes basic grammar issues like using clear paragraphs, avoiding run-on sentences, not starting every sentence with "this", etc. It also includes a logical progression of sentences within paragraphs. If your post looks like a giant text message, you won't get many points in this category.

**Originality**: You don't need to win a Pulitzer prize with your essay, but you shouldn't just repeat what the readings say. Anyone with basic literacy can repeat what they read, and that doesn't show any kind of learning or thinking. Real learning means understanding it well enough to have something to say about it. You don't need to say something that's never been said! Originality here means saying something ABOUT the readings beyond what's in the readings themselves.

**Length/Relevance**: Have you come close to the word count? Are you actually responding to the prompt or discussing something similar? These are grouped together as criteria because writing a lot that's off topic or writing a little that's on topic are pretty much the same to me.
