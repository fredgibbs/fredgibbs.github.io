# Reading Responses

## Objective
Rather than me trying to determine and assign a grade to how much you've learned from the reading assignment, you should just tell me what you thought about them. I'm interested learning in WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT THEM, not just getting a recap summary of the readings.

## Basics
- ~250 words
- Informal, but free of typos and basic grammatical errors
- Original thinking
- Posted ON TIME at UNM Learn (on your group's discussion board).

## Questions to think about
- What is the author's argument or point?
- What kind of evidence does the author use to support their argument? Is there sufficient evidence for their claims?
- What did you take away from the reading (which might be different from what the author intended)?
- What ideas did you find most interesting?
- Where did you feel the author was most unclear or confusing?
- How did the reading(s) alter your thinking about food (or not)?
- What topics weren't addressed but should have been?
- How does the assignment overlap with previous readings?

## Reflect more than summarize
I'm much more interested in reading about YOUR PERSONAL LEARNING EXPERIENCE than reading a summary of the assignment. Of course in describing what you found most interesting or what you disagreed with the most you'll end up restating some ideas from the reading. That's important! But this exercise is NOT about just regurgitating the readings.

## Don't forget your grade
At the end of your post, evaluate your own effort for that day's readings using the following scale. Individual points seem like they don't matter all that much per each assignment, but they add up over the month!

You can use half points! (.5, 1.5, 2.5); but don't do other fractions (1.8, 2.4, etc) because it leads to too much nit-picking.

- 0: You really can't give yourself a 0, because that's what you get when you don't submit a response.
- 1: **Acceptable**. Skimmed the readings quickly and your response provides a coherent but rather simplistic description of what you learned.
- 2: **Solid**. Read reasonably carefully, and your response shows you thinking critically about the ideas, arguments, and evidence presented.
- 3: **Excellent**. Read most of the assignment carefully, and your response shows you RESPONDING to (not just summarizing) various complementary or conflicting ideas presented in the readings.
- 4: **Home run**. Sometimes you'll really love a topic and write something you're REALLY proud of (both the thinking and the writing). Get an extra point for that! 

Remember that you are evaluating your effort for the assignment, not the absolute "quality" of your final response. If you spent a lot of effort learning from the readings, even if you feel your response doesn't sound particularly sophisticated, you can give yourself a 2.5 or 3.

Typically, over the course, students report mostly 2s with a bunch of 2.5s, some 3s, and a few 1s sprinkled in---and an occasional 0 for when life was unusually busy that day and an occasional 4 when they got really into something.
