# Reading Responses
- ~400 words
- Bring PAPER COPIES of your responses to class when they are due.

## Schedule
- We will divide up into three groups, but this isn't group work; everyone works independently. To keep things easy to remember, we're following a set schedule of who does what for each week.
- Tuesdays: 1: description/argument; 2: sources; 3: rest
- Wednesdays: 1: rest; 2: description/argument; 3: sources
- Thursdays: 1: sources; 2: rest; 3: description/argument

## Description/argument
- What does the text describe?
- Is there an argument, or just description?
- Are we motivated to care?
- Do the examples seem exceptional or representative?

## Sources
- What are the sources used throughout the text?
- Roughly how many sources are used?
- Roughly how many kinds of sources are used?
- Do the examples seem exceptional or representative?


## Rest
This doesn't mean you shouldn't read anything! You are still expected to answer questions at the top of the reading schedule page.
