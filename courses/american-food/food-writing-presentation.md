# Food Writing Comparison
For this assignment, which everyone will do once at some point during the course, is to read three randomly assigned essays from the food writing book and present a comparative analysis of them to the class for 8-10 min.

## Main objectives
- Briefly summarize each of the essays. This must be quick since the analysis is more important.
- Compare the writing styles and content and analysis in the essay.
- To the extent you are able (since some people present early in the semester and some nearer the end), apply the readings and our discussion to your analysis of the cookbooks
- Describe what your essays tells us about American Culture/Food/Cuisine

## Questions to keep in mind
Here are some questions to bear in mind while reading and preparing your comments. You should not and/or cannot answer all of these well in 10 minutes. Pick those that are most relevant to your particular essays
  - What kind of assumptions does the author(s) make about cooking/cuisine/food?
  - Who is the intended audience? What should they know? What should they care about?
  - What does the intended audience want?
  - What kind of writing style does the author use
  - What kind of larger themes do the cookbooks appeal to (exotic, health, comfort, regional, national, hipster, classic, etc)
  - How doe the ideas of "national" or "ethnic" or "authentic" appear?
  - You are being evaluated on the quality/depth of your ANALYSIS, NOT SUMMARY.
