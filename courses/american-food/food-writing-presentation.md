# Food Writing Comparison
I'm making this up as we go and we'll make adjustments as necessary.

Each day (probably not Mondays), 4 people will be selected at random to present the following day. Each will get a random number between 1 and 28 that denotes an essay in the Food Writing book.

The next day, you will present an informal summary and analysis to the class for 6-8 min. A brief question and answer period will follow. A chance for everyone to participate!

## Main objectives
- Briefly summarize the essay. This must be quick since the analysis is more important.
- We're reading a lot of food writing for the course; compare the writing style to other stuff we've read (in general). Do you interesting? Boring? Informative? Opinionated? Inspired? Uninformed?
- To the extent you are able (since some people present early in the semester and some nearer the end), apply the readings and our discussion to your analysis
- Describe what your essay tells us about American Culture/Food/Cuisine. Usually you need to read between the lines here, including thinking about what it means that your essay even exists and was selected as "best" food writing of 2018.

## Questions to keep in mind
Here are some questions to bear in mind while reading and preparing your comments. You should not and/or cannot answer all of these well in 8 minutes. Pick those that are most relevant to your particular essays:
- What kind of assumptions does the author(s) make about cooking/cuisine/food/food production?
- Who is the intended audience? What should they know? What should they care about?
- What kind of writing style does the author use?
- What kind of larger themes does your essay appeal to (exotic, health, comfort, regional, national, hipster, classic, etc)?
- How doe the ideas of "national" or "ethnic" or "authentic" appear?

## Analyze more than summarize
- REMEMBER You are being evaluated on the quality/depth of your ANALYSIS, NOT SUMMARY.
