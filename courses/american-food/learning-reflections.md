# Weekly Learning Reflections

## Objectives
These follow the same motivation as the more-or-less daily reading responses, except that you're reflecting over a number of topics and a more diverse set of readings. Therefore your reflections will be more synthetic and a bit longer. You should feel like you're doing more or less the same kind of reflective exercise, except more big picture as you think back on the week.

## Basics
- ~600-800 words
- Synthetic across the entire week
- Free of typos and basic grammatical errors
- Smooth, focused writing

## Questions to consider
In reflecting over the topics and readings for the week:
- What ideas from the readings did you find most interesting? Why?
- Conversely, what was least interesting to you? Why?
- How do the different topics/readings complement or contradict each other?
- What challenges did you encounter with the readings?
- What kinds of questions did the readings raise for you?

## Reflect more than summarize
As with the reading responses, I'm much more interested in reading and engaging with what you've found interesting over the course of the week---especially across the range of topics---than in slogging through a synopsis of the week's readings. A good reflection of what you've learned shows the effort you've been putting into the readings; simply paraphrasing the readings one by one really doesn't show me anything or provide evidence of your effort to learn.

## Don't forget your learning assessment
At the end of your post, evaluate your own effort for your summary and the week using the following scale (sort of same as the daily reading responses). You are encouraged to quote from your reading responses and engagement on the discussion board and Slack as evidence for your effort!

- 1-3: **Acceptable**. Skimmed the readings quickly and your response provides a coherent but rather simplistic description of what you learned.
- 4-7: **Solid**. Read the assignments reasonably carefully, and your responses show that you're thinking critically about the ideas, arguments, and evidence presented.
- 8-9: **Excellent**. Read most of the assignments carefully, and your response shows you RESPONDING to (not just summarizing) various complementary or conflicting ideas presented in the readings and across the topics for the week.
- 10: **Home run**. If you can't imagine anyone putting in more work for the course this week, this is the score for you. This would mean that you spent significant time with all the readings (not just a few from each day) and consistently posted original, expressive, and sophisticated reading responses (or other assignments). Use this highest mark sparingly!



# Final Learning Reflection
This is basically the same as the weekly reflections as described above, except it should be 1600 words long and cover the ENTIRE COURSE. You will not indicate a 0-30 score, as I will score these myself (see below).

The goal here is to describe to me what you've learned throughout the course. How has your perspective on food changed? How is your sense of food history different? To explain what you've learned is NOT THE SAME as summarizing the syllabus (I am already familiar with it!). Illustrating how your awareness about food and food history has changed is much more personal and shows a much greater depth of learning than simply listing topics possibly can.

## Make an argument for your OVERALL GRADE
I think the easiest way to nail these is to craft your Final Learning Reflection as an argument for your **overall grade for the course**. You can even start with that. You need to suggest an actual letter grade rather than a numeric score.  For example:

I think I earned a B+. I learned to think about X, Y, Z, differently because of issues E, F, and G that I hadn't considered before. I also was really interested in reading about Q, R, and S because of T, U, and V. I enjoyed the readings A, B, and C because they made me questions assumptions L, M, and N that I had initially. I would have liked to spend more time with some of the topics, such as P, Q, R, but I had to pick up extra shifts at work, so some of my reflections were a little thin. I though the readings on H and I had some good ideas but I struggled with them and didn't incorporate them into my reflections. But I was really into J and K, and thought I wrote some of the more interesting posts of the class.

You get the idea. Obviously you'll have a bit more depth to your description and what is one sentence above might be a whole paragraph in your reflection. You are telling me about YOUR learning experience. Be specific!

## I evaluate these!
Unlike the daily or weekly reflections, I give you a score for your final evaluation (0-30 points). This provides incentive to actually learn something over the course and to take care in explaining your own learning experience. Again, THERE IS NO RIGHT ANSWER OR LIST OF POINTS YOU SHOULD MAKE. If you are seriously engaged with the course over the month (granted some days we are all just scraping by), it will be EASY to explain what you've learned, justify your grade, and get near max points for the assignment.

### Dirty Secret
One reason I evaluate the final is that it helps me standardize grades across the class. While I actually do trust everyone to be honest about their effort in the responses and reflections, students who get the same grade should exhibit roughly the same effort and learning. Even within a regime of self-assessment, this largely takes care of itself over the course. But ultimately it's my job to make sure that happens since I do have to give everyone a final grade. My own assessment of your final reflections allows me to get that overall comparative perspective.

To be clear, your self-assessment throughout the course dictates your grade almost entirely---including your overall grade suggestion in the final reflection---so my evaluation of your final reflection does NOT override what you've been reporting across the reflections or your overall grade suggestion at the end. But it does factor into your final grade for the course.

Relax. I usually adjust grades upward, not downward. You will not be penalized for humility.
