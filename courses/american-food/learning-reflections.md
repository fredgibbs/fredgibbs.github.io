# Weekly Learning Reflections

## Objectives
Rather than me trying to determine and assign a grade to how much you've learned from an assignment, you should just tell me what you've learned and evaluate your own effort.

## Basics
- 600-800 words
- 1.5 line spacing
- 11pt Times New Roman
- Free of typos and basic grammatical errors
- Smooth, focused writing

## Questions to address
- What ideas did you find most novel to you?
- What thing that you've learned are you most excited about?
- What challenges have you encountered with the readings?
- How would you rate your overall effort for the week in terms of reading and thinking about the topics covered?

## Analyze more than summarize
I'm much more interested in reading about your personal learning experience than a summary of course material. Of course in describing what you found most interesting or what you disagreed with the most you'll end up restating some ideas from the reading. That very important! But this exercise is NOT about just regurgitating the readings.


# Final Learning Reflection
This is basically the same as the weekly reflections, except it should cover the ENTIRE COURSE. Use your reading responses to show how your thinking about food has changed over the month.  



## Report your OVERALL GRADE
The final learning reflection must also include your overall course grade.
