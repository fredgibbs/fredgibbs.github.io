# Weekly Learning Reflections

## Objectives
Rather than me trying to determine and assign a grade to how much you've learned from an assignment, you should just tell me what you've learned and evaluate your own effort.

## Basics
- 600-800 words
- 1.5 line spacing
- 11pt Times New Roman
- Free of typos and basic grammatical errors
- Smooth, focused writing

## Questions to address
- What ideas did you find most novel to you?
- What thing that you've learned are you most excited about?
- What challenges have you encountered with the readings?
- How would you rate your overall effort for the week in terms of reading and thinking about the topics covered?

## Analyze more than summarize
I'm much more interested in reading about your personal learning experience than a summary of course material. Of course in describing what you found most interesting or what you disagreed with the most you'll end up restating some ideas from the reading. That very important! But this exercise is NOT about just regurgitating the readings.

## Don't forget your grade
At the end of your post, evaluate your own effort for that week using the following scale (the same as the daily reading responses). You are encouraged to quote from your reading responses as evidence for your effort!

Because there is a much wider scale and a scale range for each category of effort, there is NO NEED FOR HALF POINTS.

- 0: You really can't give yourself a 0, because that's what you get when you don't submit anything.
- 1-3: **Acceptable**. Skimmed the readings quickly and your response provides a coherent but rather simplistic description of what you learned.
- 4-7: **Solid**. Read the assignments reasonably carefully, and your responses show that you're thinking critically about the ideas, arguments, and evidence presented.
- 8-9: **Excellent**. Read most of the assignments carefully, and your response shows you RESPONDING to (not just summarizing) various complementary or conflicting ideas presented in the readings.
- 10: **Home run**. Sometimes you'll really love a topic and write something you're REALLY proud of (both the thinking and the writing). Get an extra point for that!


# Final Learning Reflection
This is basically the same as the weekly reflections, except it should cover the ENTIRE COURSE. Use your reading responses to show how your thinking about food has changed over the month.  


## Suggest your OVERALL GRADE
Your final learning reflection must also include your overall course grade.
