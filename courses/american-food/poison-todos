- [ ] intro: This book often seems too long, and on more than one occasion I have thought it might be better as two separate volumes, one focused more on late medieval developments, and one on the various ways in which poison appears in early modern medical literature. Certainly such an approach would allow more space for close readings and a more detailed explication of the various toxicological arguments. But I always end up resisting such a move because it would detract from what I consider be one of the key strengths of the book as it stands: the large chronological scope that keeps the whole of premodern discussion about poison in view and is thus able to provide a new perspective on (and synthesis of) premodern toxicology that also reframes the history of toxicology as a whole.
- [ ] intro: emphasize more of my interest in category, rather than kinds of poisonS, which was not an innovation, although classificatory schemes became more complex

- [ ] 4: gentile commentary on canon -- presumably some indication of what gentile's views about avi and poison were appearing in university context
- [ ] 4: check 14th cen leprosy sources to see if poison referenced more. brenner, demaitre, touati, stearns are relevant, but not really in agreement, and they aren't looking for poison. IF NOT, which i suspect is the case, then it shows that poison was unique to plauge, but then i must temper my claim that poison was a cause of disease in general. Luke Demaitre, “The Relevance of Futility: Jordanus de Turre (fl. 1313-1335) on the Treatment of Leprosy,” Bulletin of the History of Medicine 70.1 (1996): 25-61. already took notes on this; not sure how to work in. in leprosy book: p 152!! jean fernel, poisonous property as source of contagion for leprosy. Lepers were not seen as poisonous in the same way because it was an internal corruption (from demaitre). Leprosy changed the form of the body, but not the vital spirit. Thus the nature of the disease was fundamentally different.It was only in the wake of the Black Death of 1347–50, when fears grew about the spread of disease through miasmatic (corrupt) air, that leprosy became clearly associated with contagion. In 1363, the surgeon Guy de Chauliac stated that leprosy was ‘contagious and infectious’, transmitted through air and physical contact. see Touati, ‘Contagion’, 185–198; Demaitre, Leprosy, 140.

- (12/11/2013) [+] need to dig up where paracelsus might talk about seeds.

- (12/10/2013) [+] need to seriously consider moving regulation seciton to beginning--heres' the issue/problem: lots of dangerous drugs (ESP LAXATIVES!). but it's hard to talk about them: therefore, we see more interest in definitions, and these were theoretical, and in fact this helped develop the genre in 14th cen.

- (12/10/2013) [+] modern notion of drugs is also easily clumped into over the counter, perscription, and illicit. This hardly captures the range of use of medicinal substances used in pre-modern medicine.
- (12/10/2013) [+] although poison in plague and specific form have been noted, paracelsian debates about strong drugs, etc havebeen discussed, they have not been tied to together. thinking about the nature of poison and the specializaed literature for it along with related contexts, provides an important context and history. It is not uncommon to find passing references to poison, as if the metaphor was obvious and expected. The variety of meanings of and uses of poison, the medical contexts in which it plays a prominent role, and its long and sinuous history requires a closer investigation of what physicians meant when the notion of poison played an important role in their disucsssions and its significant and changing place in medical thinking.
- (12/10/2013) [+] book conclusion: Important to note, too, that there is not a single kind of poison text. The practical guides of Maimonides, (pseudo) Arnau, pharmacological guides at Paris from Jean de St. Amand, natural philosophical guides of Arnau's treatise on theriac, Pietro d'Abano's, Natural Historical guides of Juan Gil, William de Marra and Cristoforo, are all different, but work towards the same goal of creating more accessible guides to understandin the nature of poison. Interest is all over. Montpellier, Paris, Padua. They have fully combined the theriaca and alexipharmaka traditions in a new way--which clearly had been started with Avicenna when he grouped dangerous drugs and animal bites under his section on poison.
- (12/07/2013) [+] more nuance for how to group poison treatises
- (12/05/2013) [+] intro: not comparing lists of poisons' interesting but separate endeavor--reflects more textual tradition than theory of poison. it turns out that these lists say rather little about conception of poison, since any substance could be argued as a poison or not. rather, i jave focused on explicit discussions of poision--whether it is fundamentally different from food or medicine, how to define it, it's properties.

- (08/10/2012) [+] does Lanfrank chiurgia talk about spread of poison from wounds? not that i've seen. anyway, references to venym are not entirely generic and he is much more interested in dyscrasia
- (08/10/2012) [+] avicenna, canon section de viribus cordis has plenty about poison, apparently: De viribus cordis in Avicennae arabum medicorum principis 1564 (in Z lib) 323v. well, i couldn't find it, unless there is a section in canon about it that i haven't found.
- (08/10/2012) [+] how much of this is about disease, and how much is about chemical remedies. seems like there are two separate discussions going on. can i tie some of the chemistry people to history of poison?
- (08/09/2012) [+] conclu: Our focus on poison shoudn't overly inflate its role. poison was not a driving force of medical change any more than other intellectual and cultural forces that shaped changes in medical thinking. But for many physicians, however, it DOES stand out as a way of consdiering universal vs particualr disease, materiality of disease and contagion, and of course innate powers via specific form of substances in general--which were unusuaully clearly manifest in the case of poison and the human body.
- (08/09/2012) [+] point out paradoxical nature. simultaneously a universal bad (but not necessarily evil) for the human body; but also highly dependent on circumstances (surgeons think more about venom); pharmacologhical context is more about drug/poison distinction; botanical context is about species differentiation and parts of plants. chemical context is about transmutation and purifcation--removing the much-discussed poisonous quality. in theater, as others have already investigated, it signified deception and danger. in mysogynistic text it symbolized the evil of woman and their infectious possibilites.
- (08/09/2012) [+] concl: chemical remedies taking off, professors of chemistry, etc. is part of backdrop against debates about poison fading.
- (08/09/2012) [+] in intro, point out that poison provides important backdrop to discussion about chemical and poisonous remedies. one of the goals of this chapter is to situate those debates in a much longer intellectual tradition. Claims, like those of Debus (pg 14 of Fren. Para.) that poison curing poison was novelty was obviosuyl not the case.
- (08/09/2012) [+] maybe frame paracelsus not as driving force, but an important predecessor. disease caused by poison was growing sentiment. … it's also visible in Paracelsus.
- (08/09/2012) [+] mention that as long as disease = symptoms, no reason to invesitage poison as cause of disease -- this has to be close to paracelsus, right? grmek, infection, etc.
- (08/09/2012) [+] another reason to end by late 16th cen is that chemical rememdies were becoming more frequently championed, making questions about poison vs medicine less relevant.
- (08/09/2012) [+] perhaps mention that medical stories about poisonings  provided much material for schenck's observations. Collection of anecdotal stories more than systematic argument. continued natural historical interests, and shares in the pietro d'abano tradition. Shares same interest as previous writers as understanding the medical phenomenon of poisoning, especially its relationship to rabies and bites of man, etc. shows continued interest in effects of poison that still seemed outside usual frameworks.
