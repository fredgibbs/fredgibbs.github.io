# Food Blog Analysis
This assignment asks you to apply the perspectives of the course to critiquing and analyzing how food is discussed in contemporary food blogs. It's quite similar to the early cookbook analysis we did in Week 2. (remember then?!)

## Basics
- ~800 words. But quality is more important than quantity.
- At the top of your essay, put a functional hyperlink to the blogs you reference


## What to do
- Remind yourself what we did with the early cookbook analysis. You're basically doing the same thing here with a slight twist.
- Identify at least THREE food blogs that you want to skim through (I think the assignment is more fun if you skim through a few more, since you have more to draw from). These can be ones you already know or ones that you've never seen before.
  - You can find collections of food blog links [here](https://americanfoodbloggers.com/) and [here](https://bloggingtips.com/best-food-blogs/) and [here](https://www.chefspencil.com/best-30-food-blogs-in-2020/). You'll notice there is a lot of overlap on these. You can also CHOOSE WHATEVER BLOGS YOU WANT. The particular sites you use are of no consequence, but it's best to avoid super specialized ones for the purposes of this exercise.
- Click through the blogs (especially the "about" pages, a handful of recipes, photography, etc) to get a sense of what each is trying to do. Think about tone, style, assumptions about food, cooking, etc.
- Make sure you're answering the question about the future historian as stated below!


## Questions to keep in mind while reading and writing?
- Who is the intended audience? What do they know? Are they intimidated by cooking? Are they already proficient cooks?
- What kind of assumptions does the author(s) make about cooking/cuisine/food?
- What kind of larger themes do the blogs appeal to (exotic, health, comfort, frugality, regional or national food, etc)?
- What are the various "national" or "ethnic" influences of the recipes or instructions?
- How much does tradition or originality matter to the author? Is there a lot of appropriation at work? Or just the embodiment of American food?
- How do your blogs help construct an American identity or a sense of "American food"?
- Just like we looked at cookbooks from ~150 years ago to learn about food at the time, what would a historian 150 years from now think American food if looking at your blogs?
- REMEMBER: You're READING BETWEEN THE LINES to learn about American culture and cuisine.


## Questions
Writing is hard enough, and virtually impossible when you're not sure what you're trying to do. Please get in touch!
