## _{{page.site-name}}_ Revision Guide

This guide is useful ONLY AFTER you have followed the directions for [setting up your repository](food-stories-setup).

Once you have your own copy of the  _{{page.site-name}}_ repository AND your own version of the website is running (the URL will look like https://USERNAME.github.io/{{page.repository-name}}/), you are ready to proceed.

### Save time with bookmarks
Create bookmarks for two locations you will be visiting often:
- YOUR own _{{page.site-name}}_ **REPOSITORY**: https://github.com/USERNAME/{{page.repository-name}}/
  - Replace USERNAME with your GitHub username!
- YOUR own _{{page.site-name}}_ **WEBSITE**: https://USERNAME.github.io/{{page.repository-name}}


## Create a folder and blank page
Go to YOUR repository (the URL will look like https://github.com/USERNAME/{{page.repository-name}}/). You should see the list of files in the repository (starting with folders like _data,_includes, _layouts, etc).

- Click the `stories` folder 
- Click the `Add file` button in the upper right, and `Create New File`
- Type in a folder name for your essay:
  - all lower case and with dashes
  - example: my-food-story), and continue typing `/index.md` - **DON'T FORGET THE / AT THE BEGINNING**

{% include alert.html class='danger' 
title = 'Name your folder correctly' 
text = " 
It is IMPERATIVE that you name your folder correctly right away, or you will create A LOT of work for yourself (and probably me) later. 
- all lower case, NO CAPITALS ANYWHERE
- no spaces, no underscores, ONLY DASHES
- it should like `mesa-vista-hall` or `maxwell-museum` or `johnson-field`
"
%}


- Click the green `Commit changes...` button. Yes, you're saving an empty file.

# Copy a sample page into your blank page
- Be sure you're still in the `stories` folder.
- Click on the `bbq` folder
- Click on the `index.md` file 
- Near the upper right of the screen, click the copy icon (two overlapping rectangles)
- Click on your new page (index.md) in the folder you created, and paste the text you just copied.
 - Click the green `Commit changes...` button.


## Test your page
- Chill for a minute because there is about a minute lag between when you save your file and the website getting updated.
- Test your page by going to https://USERNAME.github.io/{{page.repository-name}} (you bookmarked it, right?) and add  `/stories/YOUR-NEW-FOLDER/` to the URL to see your new page. Obviously replace your-new-folder with what you typed in the previous step.
- You should also be able to go to https://USERNAME.github.io/{{page.repository-name}}/stories 


#### Bookmark your page!
Once you can get to your page, bookmark it! It's easy to forget what th URL is to preview your page.
