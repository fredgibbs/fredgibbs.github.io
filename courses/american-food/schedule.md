# IN PROGRESS!
This syllabus is a living document and changes frequently (seriously!), depending on what's going on in the course. If you print it out, you'll need to keep your paper version up to date with the online version. I will always announce important changes in class. Although details will change, the general workload and assignments will not change significantly, so you can still plan around what's listed.

As they are solidified, more precise class activities (and any preparatory work) will be detailed on the appropriate days.

Reading assignments will be adjusted as we move along, but the general reading amount will not increase. Also, note that the reading assignment tends to be heaviest earlier in the week and gradually declines throughout the week.
