# Schedule of Readings & Assignments


### Due dates
All posted assignments are technically "due" on the day they are listed so that we all stay on schedule. An occasional late post because something urgent came up is fine. Repeatedly late posts will negatively impact your grade.

### Video lectures
All video lectures are posted on the [course YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeiHxkIHW5kM1hqofknf2ig), and I will link to them on the syllabus as they become available. If you want announcements of new videos, please subscribe to the channel.

## July 2 (Friday)
No new reading for today! But start drafting your [Final Course Reflection](final-course-reflections). These are TECHNICALLY due tomorrow (the official last day of the 1H period), but everyone has some extra time UNTIL MONDAY to make it nice. You can of course submit it whenever you'd like.

This final lecture will highlight some of the key themes and ideas that I hope stick with you long after the course and to jump start your thinking on your Final Learning Reflection (see the very last day).

Your FINAL Learning Reflection---over the WHOLE CLASS---is officially due today (but feel free to revise and submit it MONDAY). See the [Final Course Reflection Guide](final-course-reflections). I can't emphasize enough that this SHOULD NOT BE A SUMMARY of what we've covered.
