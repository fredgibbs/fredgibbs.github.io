# IN PROGRESS!
This syllabus is a living document and changes frequently (seriously!), depending on what's going on in the course. If you print it out, you'll need to keep your paper version up to date with the online version. I will always announce important changes in class. Although details will change, the general workload and assignments will not change significantly, so you can still plan around what's listed.

As they are solidified, more precise class activities (and any preparatory work) will be detailed on the appropriate days.

Reading assignments will be adjusted as we move along, but the general reading amount will not increase. Also, note that the reading assignment tends to be heaviest earlier in the week and gradually declines throughout the week.

### Cookbooks as Historical Sources
The following two articles provide VERY useful ways of thinking about using cookbooks as historical sources. Read them carefully enough that you can apply their techniques to other cookbooks.
- Arjun Appadurai, “How to Make a National Cuisine: Cookbooks in Contemporary India,” 3–24. [JSTOR](http://www.jstor.org.libproxy.unm.edu/stable/179020)

### Early Cookbooks

- Read the little blurbs about more cookbooks [here](http://www.americantable.org/2015/12/top-12-most-influential-historic-american-cookbooks/)

- Amelia Simmons, [American Cookery](https://books.google.com/books?id=_6CggcPs3iQC). Read the introduction by Karen Hess (ix-xv), and skim through the recipes. What stands out to you?

- For the following (all mentioned on the Early American Cookbooks page), there are no specific pages to read. But skim through the books and read a recipe here and there so you have a sense of their similarities and differences.
  - Lydia Child, [American Frugal Housewife](https://books.google.com/books?id=D3AEAAAAYAAJ)
  - Mary Randolph [The Virginia Housewife](https://books.google.com/books?id=R4YEAAAAYAAJ)

### Discussion (in class)
- Using the What strikes you as most surprising or bizarre about the cookbooks? How did they affirm or complicate your ideas of American food?

### Impromptu Group Research Reports (in class)
- Compare two from [here](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/mb?c=1934413200;a=listis)
  - Hint: spend some time finding a good pair!

### Note assignment due MONDAY!



## Jun 12

### Immigration
- Wallach, 57-87 (Expansion and Immigration). Read this for basic historical background and culinary changes underway.
- Gabbacia, 36-63 (Immigration, Isolation, Industry). Don't worry about the details in the stories, but think about what Gabaccia is trying to say in the chapter as a whole.


### Genealogy
- Our Twitty reading for this week is a fair number of pages, but as you've already seen, they go by quick. Read quickly over parts that aren't interesting to you--but be ready to talk about WHY Twitty is describing what he does.
  - Twitty, Chapters 5 (Missing Pieces), 81-89; 8 (0.01 Percent), 119-139; 9 (Sweet Tooth), 141-159.



## Jun 13

### Boundaries of Taste
- Gabaccia, 93-121 (Crossing the Boundaries of Taste).
- Horowitz, 1-41 (Intro, Beef). There is more detail in here than we need, but try to formulate a overview of beef in the U.S. What are the major drivers of change with respect to beef production and consumption?



## Jun 14

### Moral Eating
EVERYONE:
- Charlotte Biltekoff, _Eating Right in America_, 1-11 (Cultural Politics) [PDF](readings/cultural-politics.pdf); 13-44 (Scientific Moralization) [PDF](readings/scientific-moralization.pdf).
- Wilbur Atwater, "Chemistry, Foods, Nutrition" (1887), 59-74. [PDF](readings/chemistry-food-nutrition.pdf).

SPLIT UP:
- Wallach, 143-67 (Pious and Patriotic Stomach).
- Gabaccia, 122-48 (American Values).

Regardless of which you read, be prepared to answer the following in class:
- What is the author's argument or point to the chapter?
- What kind of evidence do they use to support their argument?
- Do they have appropriate sources? Sufficient evidence for their claims?
- How do these chapters overlap with previous readings?


## Jun 18

- Kauffman, 1-18 (Intro); 58-96 (Brown Rice and Macrobiotics); 97-130 (Brown Bread). This book is heavy on microbiography and anecdotal stories. You can skim over these quickly--but keep trying to formulate the main message

- Harvey A. Levenstein, _Paradox of Plenty_ (Fast Foods and Quick Bucks), 227-236. [PDF](readings/fast-food-quick-bucks.pdf)

### Economic Analyses

- NOTE: This discussion will be VERY useful for your book review assignment due next week.


## Jun 21
