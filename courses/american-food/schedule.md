## 1: Aug 19 + 21
Our task for this week is to make sure we're all on the same page about how the course is structured and general expectations.


### Aug 19: Course introductions
- Syllabus + course overview

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Syllabus Quiz' text="
Don't lose points by making assumptions. This quiz is due by Friday, but do it early so you don't forget.

### Aug 21: Challenges and Rewards of Food + History
The whole course makes more sense when you understand how and why people study food the way they do. The Haley reading that argues we should resist the urge to romanticize the culinary past as is so often done in food media because: A) it's never that simple and B) the real history is far more interesting and revealing.


- Warren Belasco, "Why study food?", from _Food: The Key Concepts_, 1--13.
- Andrew P. Haley, "The Nation before Taste: The Challenges of American Culinary History", _The Public Historian_ 34.2 (2012): 53--78.
- G. J. Fitzgerald and G. M. Petrick, "In Good Taste: Rethinking American History with Our Palates", _Journal of American History_ 95.2 (2008): 392--404.

Another quiz this week just to keep us on the same page. You'll find quizzes are infinitely easier after class.

## 2: Aug 26 + 28

### Aug 26: American Food
The goal for today is to complicate the idea of "American" food.  There are an unusually high number of readings for today, but they are all quite short and offer unique perspectives that are worth thinking about together.

- _HAE_, xi--xv. _HAE_ refers to _How America Eats_ as described on the syllabus home page. You can access it for [free through UNM Libraries](https://unm-worldcat-org.libproxy.unm.edu/title/how-america-eats-a-social-history-of-us-food-and-culture/oclc/794361344&referer=brief_results).
- _Mind of Chef_: [Ed Lee on American Food](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5DZui1nrAs)
- Ruth Tobias, [Is There Such a Thing as 'American' Food?](https://www.tastingtable.com/culture/national/defining-american-food-cuisine). This article touches on culinary/cultural appropriation, which is a topic we cover in some depth in a few weeks, so focus for no
- Sidney Mintz, "Eating American". (Remember, if there's no link, it's in the Zotero library). This is easily the most controversial piece this week, suggesting there is no such thing as American Cuisine. We'll discuss in class how much you agree or disagree with his argument.


### Aug 28: National Cuisines
Today we'll broaden out our discussion of American food to discuss national cuisine generally.
- Alison K. Smith, [National Cuisines](https://www-oxfordhandbooks-com.libproxy.unm.edu/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199729937.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199729937-e-25), from _The Oxford Handbook of Food History_ (2012). 
  - Skim/skip over the long Russia example at the end, but do read the last paragraph! This is definitely the driest of the readings for this week, but it introduces a number of useful concepts to keep in mind as moving through the other readings.


{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Reading reflection' text="
1. Make sure you're familiar with the [reading reflection guide](reading-reflections).
2. Drawing from ALL the readings: What are the most useful ideas for thinking about national cuisine that you noted? Can a national cuisine be defined by its diversity (as Lee and Tobias suggest)? Or does such diversity mean there really isn't an American cuisine (as Mintz suggests)? **Does the difficulty of defining a national cuisine complicate the idea of 'Americanness'?** In other words, does the difficulty in defining an American cuisine suggest the same difficulties in defining American anything?
"%}



## 3: Sep 2 + 4
Almost everyone thinks about whether some kind of food or dish is "authentic" from time to time. But what does that really mean? The few readings for today should help us think more carefully notions of authenticity---particularly how it's paradoxically an entirely superficial way of describing food, but still a very powerful one.

### Sep 2: Authenticity I
- Rachel Laudan, [Desperately Seeking Authenticity](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2001-dec-19-fo-16368-story.html)
- Dwight Furrow, _American Foodie_ (7: Habits and Heresies: Authenticity, Food Rules, and Traditions), 133--48.


### Sep 4: Authenticity II
- Jeffrey Pratt, "Food Values: The Local and the Authentic," 285--300.
- Sara Kay, [Yelp Reviewers' Authenticity Fetish Is White Supremacy in Action](https://ny.eater.com/2019/1/18/18183973/authenticity-yelp-reviews-white-supremacy-trap).
- Clarissa Wei, [What does authentic Chinese food even mean?](https://www.epicurious.com/ingredients/chinese-food-a-celebration-of-time-and-place)
- Matthew Strohl, 'On Culinary Authenticity', _The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism_, 77.2 (2019), 157--67.



## 4: Sep 9 + 11

### Sep 9: Cuisines of Contact 
- _HAE_, 1--31 (from Ch. 1: Cuisine of Contact).
  - This chapter gives us a lot of basic background information, but also very useful analysis of the _meanings_ of food. For example, we learn how uses of food were essential to Puritan identity, especially the concern for feasting or fasting too much or too little. Puritans were afraid of both abundance and scarcity, as they saw food as means to survive, not a source of enjoyment.
- Keith Stavely and Kathleen Fitzgerald, _America's Founding Food_ (1: This Beautifull Noble Eare), read 4--15 and 45--48 more carefully; skim (but don't skip) 15--45 on the various dishes.
  - In the early pages, look for how corn figured into different cultural value systems
  - In the section you're skimming: What do the recipes do? What's the point? They illustrate through specific examples (maybe too many) how many Native American culinary traditions were incorporated into English traditions, how English traditions adapted to new geographic circumstances, and how many Native American traditions were gradually were assimilated into what would be considered quintessentially American dishes (Riinjun bread into Boston Brown Bread).



### Sep 11: More Corn
- Michael Pollan, _Omnivore's Dilemma_, (Chap. 2: The Farm), 32--56. The point of this reading (it's the fastest read for today) is to get a sense of the commoditization of corn and why it's so cheap now. And to compare the meaning of corn as discussed in the other readings with how it's portrayed in this chapter.
- Erick Castellanos and Sarah Bergstresser, "The Mexican and Transnational Lives of Corn: Technological, Political, Edible Object", in _Edible Identities_ (ed. Broulotte and Di Giovine), Taylor & Francis (2016), 201--216.


{% include alert.html class='info' title='Corn' text="
[Ever wonder what tassles are for?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEmbOFsqld8) This explains the reproduction and maturity of dent corn, the most common kind of corn grown in the US, mostly for animal feed. The corn on the cob you like slathered with butter is sweet corn, and it reproduces the same way, but loses less moisture and is, as you might guess, sweeter. The other kind of corn you like to eat is popcorn, which has a non-porous hull. If you heat the kernel, the water in the kernel turns to steam, expands, and [turns inside out really slowly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSZd33awqQk), so you can munch on the starchy interior.
"%}

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Reading Quiz' text="
This quiz covers early food consumption in early America, how food and personal/community/national identity were intertwined (as we see in attitudes about corn) and how meanings of food can be utterly transformed over time.
"%}


## 5: Sep 16 + 18

### Sep 16: Early America, Food, and Households

- _HAE_, 33--55 (2: Food and the Founding). Continuing our emphasis on food and identity, this chapter covers how capitalism and food were central to shaping early American identity. Both this chapter and the other reading emphasize the importance of capitalist markets, food production, and the development of cookbooks as a way of cultivating an American cuisine (and identity).
- Keith Stavely and Kathleen Fitzgerald, _America's Founding Food_ (4: Cookbooks and Commerce), 120--147. Even though not clearly marked, there are two distinct parts to this reading. 
  - SKIM the first part (to 129), which explains the capitalist logic of food production in the late 1700s and early 1800s, and how central food was to economic growth. 
  - The second part (129+) shows how early cookbooks start reflect the cultural changes underway during that time. 
  - Both complement the _HAE_ reading with considerable more detail about the role of women in managing food, the household, and shaping American foodways.


### Sep 18: 
- James E. McWilliams, "'How Unripe We Are'", _Food, Culture & Society_ 8.2 (2005): 143–60.

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Reading Reflection' text="
What did you learn from the readings this week? Remember the goal of these reflections is to show your familiarity with the readings---BOTH of them, as they are quite distinct. The more you can describe, the higher your score will be, so you should aim to cover a range of topics that are prominent in the readings. The reading descriptions above might help you identify key themes that are worth elaborating on.
"%}





## 6: Sept 23 + 25

### Sep 23: Expansion and Immigration
- _HAE_, 57--87 (3: Expansion and Immigration).


### Sep 25: Restaurants as Agents of Change
- Samantha Barbas, “‘I’ll Take Chop Suey’: Restaurants as Agents of Culinary and Cultural Change”, _The Journal of Popular Culture_, 36.4 (2003): 669–86. As a complement to the _HAE_ chapter, this article vividly illustrates how a certain kind of cuisine is adopted, adapted, and transformed into the melting pot of American food. There is way more detail than we need here, but Barbas paints an intriguing portrait of the creation of Chinese American food, which I would say has been one of the most vibrant genres of cookbooks in the last few years.

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Reading Quiz' text="
This quiz focuses on instances when AND WHY food traditions were blending together and when they were remaining distinct. It would be useful to think about the differences in tone between _HAE_ and the Barbas article.
"%}



## 7: Sep 30 + Oct 2 

### Sep 30: History from Cookbooks
- Between the [Cookbook Analysis Guide](cookbook-analysis) and the readings for today that demonstrate exactly what you should do with your cookbooks, you already have everything you need to know.
- Ken Albala, [Cookbooks as Historical Documents](https://www-oxfordhandbooks-com.libproxy.unm.edu/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199729937.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199729937-e-13). This highly skimmable chapter nicely lays out a process for interrogating cookbooks and reading in between the lines with many excellent examples.
- Rachel A. Snell, [As North American as Pumpkin Pie: Cookbooks and the Development of National Cuisine in North America, 1796-1854](https://www.erudit.org/fr/revues/cuizine/2014-v5-n2-cuizine01533/1026771ar/). This title is misleading, as the article is more about how cookbooks can be used to create a national identity more than a cuisine. And that's precisely why it's interesting and useful to us in thinking about how to read old cookbooks. The analysis here is a great example of what I hope you'll do (on a much smaller scale) with your own cookbooks.


### Oct 2: Using Cookbooks
- Harry Haff, _The Founders of American Cuisine: Seven Cookbook Authors, with Historical Recipes_ (2: Amelia Simmons), 21--33. We're looking at this as an example of how the author analyzes Simmons's cookbook, particularly the way the author comments on how explanation or ambiguities in the recipes reflect what readers would know or not know.
- Barbara Ketcham Wheaton, "Cookbook as Resources for Social History". This chapter very nicely sketches out, with many diverse examples, how cookbooks function as windows onto history, including how and why they were used in the world.
- Keith Stavely and Kathleen Fitzgerald, _United Tastes: The Making of the First American Cookbook_ (2: Culinary Tradition), 29--51. This provides a fascinating cultural background of cookbooks and their evolution. Honestly the first few sentences of each paragraph will give you enough background.
- Colleen Cotter, "Claiming a Piece of the Pie", 51--68.
- Jane C. Busch, "Using Cookbooks as Research Documents", 22--25.

#### Some cookbooks mentioned in the readings
- Amelia Simmons, [American Cookery](https://books.google.com/books?id=_6CggcPs3iQC)
- Lydia Child, [American Frugal Housewife](https://books.google.com/books?id=D3AEAAAAYAAJ)
- Mary Randolph [The Virginia Housewife](https://books.google.com/books?id=R4YEAAAAYAAJ)
- Eliza Leslie, [Miss Leslie\'s Complete Cookery](https://books.google.com/books?id=KVL5oJA8IWsC)

## 9: Oct 14 + 16
Is anything more American than "health food" and cereal for breakfast? 

### Oct 14: Improving Nature
Today we look at an interesting early connection between food, health, and technology that still influences our food choices.
- Katherine Turner, _How the Other Half Ate_ (Ch. 2: Factories, Railroads, and Rotary Eggbeaters), eBook pp. 40--48 (read up to the "Working Class Kitchens" heading). [[online through UNM](https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/unm/detail.action?docID=1574614)]


### Oct 16: Cereal
- Sarah Pruitt, "[How an Accidental Invention Changed What Americans Eat for Breakfast](https://www.history.com/news/cereal-breakfast-origins-kellogg)"
- Blake Hatton, [The Early Years of American Ready to Eat Breakfast Cereal: The Breakfast Cereal Revolution Until 1930](https://scalar.usc.edu/works/early-years-of-ready-to-eat-breakfast-cereal/index).
- Jaya Saxena, [How Cereal Became the Quintessential American Breakfast](https://www.seriouseats.com/2015/03/history-of-breakfast-cereal-mascots.html). This is fun for for its focus on advertising.

## 10: Oct 21 + 23
Building off the theme of how dietary and moral advice are frequently intertwined, today we look at how popularization of nutritional science provided the perfect "objective" rationale for telling the working classes (and especially immigrants) how they should eat. As we'll see, the goal seems to have been as much as about health as it was to encourage immigrants to be more economically efficient, and therefore  "more American". This topic may seem unique to the early 19th century and immigration, but even in 2025, a healthier body is still often thought of as a "better" body. The health industry is worth a gazillion dollars in part because it's not just about health!

### Oct 21: Nutrition, Economy, and Citizenship
The idea that we should make decisions on what to eat based on a supposedly objective metric of health has been labelled _nutritionism_---an ISM like catholocism, totalitarianism---an IDEOLOGY of food and how to eat. There is even an official disorder called _orthorexia_---wanting to eat "right". This is often presented as a relatively new (last 40 or 50 years at most) phenomenon, but it actually has a LONG. It is striking that considering how much culture is very different now, and nutritional knowledge has advanced considerably since ~1900, the idea that we can assess and measure morality through food, diet, and health has persisted remarkably well.

- Katherine Turner, _How the Other Half Ate_ (Ch. 1: The Problem of Food), ebook pp. 14--39. [[online through UNM](https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/unm/detail.action?docID=1574614)] This book gives us excellent background on working-class life in the U.S. around 1900. There is way more detail than we need (but helps ground the analysis in specific examples as I'm always asking you to do), so be sure you're reading to grasp the big picture of who the working class are, how they eat, and what they value (and don't) in food.

### Oct 23: Scientific Moralization
- Charlotte Biltekoff, _Eating Right in America_ (Ch. 2: Scientific Moralization), 13--44. This reading illustrates how early nutritional scientists and social reformers tried to contain and order the chaos of diverse tastes, preferences, and eating habits of all the different people immigrating to the U.S. from the 1880s to the 1920s. The emphasis on dietary habits was a way of creating/maintaining a more consistent societal fabric. In the minds of social reformers, there was too much cultural and culinary diversity; the country needed a standard way of eating to make a stronger and more unified, more civilized bodies of citizens. Note how this is somewhat contrary to the blending/adaptation narrative we've read about at times with respect to various food traditions. Biltekoff claims that all dietary advice has a strong moral component to it. I disagree that all dietary advice is _necessarily_ moral, but I would say it USUALLY has a significant moral component, even as we might suppose that the language of science is objective. But we have to remember objective metrics are _always subjective_ in how they are applied and valued.


{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Reading Quiz' text="
Just to make sure you're reading the syllabus and red boxes: You'll read about Wilbur Atwater and his work on nutrition in the late nineteenth century. But you might wonder why vitamins aren't discussed in more depth, but (as very briefly mentioned in the article) that's because they weren't discovered yet and the nutritive value of food was determined by other variables.

Industrializing Meat


### Oct 28: Beef
- Joshua Specht, [The price of plenty: how beef changed America](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/may/07/the-price-of-plenty-how-beef-changed-america)



### Oct 30: Chicken
- Emeyln Rude, _Tastes like Chicken_, 6--11; 27--39; 130--134; 141--160; 181--192. Sorry for all the partial sections here; the PDF is just the pages you need to read. The book tends to go off on lots of cool tangents, so we skip around to stay on topic. This looks like a crazy amount of reading, but the physical pages and number of words on them are quite small, and many pages are recipes that you can skip over. It goes by really fast, and it's a fun non-academic read.

## 13: Nov 11 + 13
As you are all well aware, the Southwest has a pretty amazing mix of foodways. While we've read in general terms about blending of food traditions, this week is we have two primary goals: 
- Learn more about the various historical traditions of food in the Southwest
- Look in more depth at a specific region as a site of adaptation and resistance to new foods.


### Nov 11: Untangling Food in the Southwest
- Jeffrey M. Pilcher, “Tex-Mex, Cal-Mex, New Mex, or Whose Mex? Notes on the Historical Geography of Southwestern Cuisine”. _Journal of the Southwest_ 43.44 (2001): 659-–79. Like many sources we've used, there is more detail than we need. But you know how to handle that by this point---read for the big picture!
- Anastacia Uriegas, [Fajitas, Queso & Enchiladas: A Look at the Origins of Tex-Mex Favorites](https://remezcla.com/features/culture/fajitas-queso-enchiladas-look-origins-tex-mex-favorites/)


### Nov 13: Culinary Borderlands
- Katherine Massoth, "'Mexican Cookery that Belongs to the United States': Evolving Boundaries of Whiteness in New Mexican Kitchens", in _Food Across Borders_ (ed. Garcia, DuPuis, and Mitchell), 44--59. I love this article because it tells a clear story about the intersection of race, culture, and food with abundant historical examples. As much as we've read about mingling of ingredients and merging of dishes, most students get a new perspective on food and identity from this reading.


{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Reading Reflection' text="
BASED ON THE READINGS: What does the history of food in the Southwest teach us about food, culture, and identity that we haven't exactly seen before? However much you interject your own opinion (and I hope you will!), please be sure your post addresses the prompt question and draws specifically from the readings this week!

## 14: Nov 18 + 20

### Nov 18: Culinary Diffusion
We've already looked at the intersection of food traditions in the Southwest, and today we look at food moving out of specific regions. We've already covered this a little with our reading on Chinese food in the 19th century, but here focus specifically on diffusion as a general concept and how meanings of food get twisted as food moves around geographies and cultures.

- Helen Zoe Veit, _Modern Food, Moral Food_ (6: Americanizing the American Diet), 123--56.
- Amy Bentley, "From Culinary Other to Mainstream America: Meanings and Uses of Southwestern Cuisine", in _Culinary Tourism_ (ed. Lucy M. Long), University Press of Kentucky (2013), 209--223.

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Reading reflection' text="
It's easy to characterize the blending of food traditions simply as everything going into the good ol' American melting pot. But what do these articles suggest we can learn about American foodways if we look more closely? In other words, how do these articles suggest ideas about diffusion that we haven't seen before?

### Nov 20: Food Blog Analysis
{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Food Blog Analysis' text="
Think back to the cookbook readings, when we discussed how much you can learn about people, culture, and food from cookbooks. Just like we looked at cookbooks from ~150 years ago to learn about food at the time, what would a historian 150 years from now think American food was from looking at your blogs?

## 15: Thanksgiving
Just one meeting this week, and we're going back in time a little to examine the historical construction of Thanksgiving. Lots of ideas for the dinner table!

### Nov 25: Thanksgiving
- Philip Deloria, “[The Invention of Thanksgiving](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/11/25/the-invention-of-thanksgiving)”, _New Yorker_, 95.37 (November 25, 2019): 70--74. [Also in Zotero if the link doesn't work.]
- Janet Siskind, “The Invention of Thanksgiving: A Ritual of American Nationality", 167--91.
- [First Thanksgiving Menu](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/what-was-on-the-menu-at-the-first-thanksgiving-511554/). This quick read serves two purposes: it's a nice overview of what food were likely available at the harvest celebration of 1621. And it's a good example of uncritical food history that focuses entirely on food without much of the historical context (neither in the 1600s or 1900s).


### Nov 27: THANKSGIVING!



## 16: Dec 2 - 4

### Dec 2: Culinary Appropriation
I find most culinary appropriation conversations to be unhelpfully superficial. It is pointless:
- to debate whether culinary/cultural appropriation actually happens (it does)
- whether it's just some people being overly sensitive (it is)
- whether it can be an inadvertent or purposeful tool of marginalization (it can). 

These are non-debatable facts. What matters for today is how we can learn to think and talk about appropriation in a sufficiently nuanced way that encourages innovation and adaptation in terms of food while simultaneously respecting cultural heritage and meanings.
- Michael Twitty, _The Cooking Gene_, 1--24.

### Dec 4: Course Conclusions
No readings for today, but crucial tips for succeess on your [final course reflection](final-course-reflection) due next week! 



## Dec 12 Finals Due
 This final video will highlight some of the key themes and ideas that I hope will help you with your Final Course Reflection and even stick with you long after the course.

Your FINAL Learning Reflection---over the WHOLE CLASS---needs to be turned in BY THE END OF TODAY. See the [Final Course Reflection Guide](final-course-reflection). I can't emphasize enough that this SHOULD NOT BE MERELY A SUMMARY of what we've covered. Instead, as the instructions explain in more detail, illustrate how your thinking about food has changed over the month, and how your submitted work justifies what you think should be your overall grade for the course.
