"%}


## 1: Aug 19 + 21
Our task for this week is to make sure we're all on the same page about how the course is structured and general expectations.


### Aug 19: Course introductions
- Syllabus + course overview

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Syllabus Quiz' text="
Don't lose points by making assumptions. This quiz is due by Friday, but do it early so you don't forget.
"%}

### Aug 21: Challenges and Rewards of Food + History
- Warren Belasco, "Why study food?", from _Food: The Key Concepts_, 1--13.
- Andrew P. Haley, "The Nation before Taste: The Challenges of American Culinary History", _The Public Historian_ 34.2 (2012): 53--78.

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Why + How to Study Food Quiz' text="
Another quiz this week to get us warmed up and shake up assumptions. You'll find quizzes are infinitely easier after attending class.
"%}



## 2: Aug 26 + 28

### Aug 26: American Food
The goal for today is to complicate the idea of "American" food.  There are an unusually high number of readings for today, but they are all quite short and offer unique perspectives that are worth thinking about together.

- _HAE_, xi--xv. (Remember that _HAE_ refers to _How America Eats_ as described with a link at the top of the page.)
- _Mind of Chef_: [Ed Lee on American Food](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5DZui1nrAs)
- Ruth Tobias, [Is There Such a Thing as 'American' Food?](https://www.tastingtable.com/culture/national/defining-american-food-cuisine). This article touches on culinary/cultural appropriation, which is a topic we cover in some depth in a few weeks, so focus for no
- Sidney Mintz, "Eating American". (Remember, if there's no link, it's in the Zotero library). This is easily the most controversial piece this week, suggesting there is no such thing as American Cuisine. We'll discuss in class how much you agree or disagree with his argument.

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Avoid the Quiz' text="
If we can have a fun discussion about the idea of American food, I'll cancel the quiz for today. This means robust participation and clear engagement with the readings. Come prepared to discuss what assumptions and stereotypes go into ideas about American food and/or cuisine. Also consider some broader questions (that we'll get into Thursday in more detail) like can anything really be ascribed to a particular nation. What is national anything? What is it a shortcut for?
"%}


### Aug 28: National Cuisines
Today we'll broaden out our discussion of American food to discuss national cuisine generally.
- Alison K. Smith, [National Cuisines](https://www-oxfordhandbooks-com.libproxy.unm.edu/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199729937.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199729937-e-25), from _The Oxford Handbook of Food History_, **part 5, chapter 25** (2012). 
  - Skim/skip over the long Russia example at the end, but do read the last paragraph! This is definitely the driest of the readings for this week, but it clearly articulates several useful concepts that help us get a bigger perspective on the topic. Usually each paragraph introduces a new idea to how we can analyze 'national' food/cuisine, so it's very organized that way, but there isn't a particular 'flow' to it, which makes it easy to feel lost. Just look for the next point!


{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Weekly reflection' text="
1. Make sure you're familiar with the [reading reflection guide](reading-reflections).
2. Drawing from the readings as a whole (not just Thursday): Which ways of thinking about national cuisine did you find most and least persuasive---and why? If someone references a kind of 'national' food, what questions should come to mind? Is there such thing as a 'national' food in general (whether American, Italian, Mexican)?
"%}



## 3: Sep 2 + 4
Almost everyone thinks about whether some kind of food or dish is "authentic" from time to time. But what does that really mean? The few readings for today should help us think more carefully notions of authenticity---particularly how it's paradoxically an entirely superficial way of describing food, but still a very powerful one.

### Sep 2: Authenticity I
- Rachel Laudan, [Desperately Seeking Authenticity](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2001-dec-19-fo-16368-story.html)
- Dwight Furrow, _American Foodie_ (7: Habits and Heresies: Authenticity, Food Rules, and Traditions), 133--48.


### Sep 4: Authenticity II
{% include alert.html class='warning' title='NO CLASS TODAY!' text="
The semester is long; this week is short. Read the two SHORT assignments below (and enjoy the photos in the 2nd one!), and use them in your weekly reflection.
"%}

- Sara Kay, [Yelp Reviewers' Authenticity Fetish Is White Supremacy in Action](https://ny.eater.com/2019/1/18/18183973/authenticity-yelp-reviews-white-supremacy-trap). I don't agree with the conclusions of this article, but I want you to understand the argument. What else can an "authenticity fetish" represent?
- Clarissa Wei, [What does authentic Chinese food even mean?](https://www.epicurious.com/ingredients/chinese-food-a-celebration-of-time-and-place)
- CHALLENGE: Matthew Strohl, 'On Culinary Authenticity', _The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism_, 77.2 (2019), 157--67.
- CHALLENGE: Jeffrey Pratt, "Food Values: The Local and the Authentic," 285--300.


{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Weekly Reflection' text="
Tell me what you learned about the notion of authenticity this week. As always, show me that you're using the readings by providing specific quotes and examples, and SYNTHESIZING what the authors are doing. 
"%}



## 4: Sep 9 + 11

### Sep 9: Cuisines of Contact 
- _HAE_, 1--31 (from Ch. 1: Cuisine of Contact).
  - This chapter gives us a lot of basic background information, but also very useful analysis of the _meanings_ of food. For example, we learn how uses of food were essential to Puritan identity, especially the concern for feasting or fasting too much or too little. Puritans were afraid of both abundance and scarcity, as they saw food as means to survive, not a source of enjoyment.
- Keith Stavely and Kathleen Fitzgerald, _America's Founding Food_ (1: This Beautifull Noble Eare), read 4--15 and 45--48 more carefully; skim (but don't skip) 15--45 on the various dishes.
  - In the early pages, look for how corn figured into different cultural value systems
  - In the section you're skimming: What do the recipes do? What's the point? They illustrate through specific examples (maybe too many) how many Native American culinary traditions were incorporated into English traditions, how English traditions adapted to new geographic circumstances, and how many Native American traditions were gradually were assimilated into what would be considered quintessentially American dishes (Riinjun bread into Boston Brown Bread).

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Reading / Discussion Quiz' text="
This quiz examaines early food consumption in early America, how food and personal/community/national identity were intertwined (as we see in attitudes about corn) and how meanings of food can be utterly transformed over time.
"%}


### Sep 11: More Corn
- Michael Pollan, _Omnivore's Dilemma_, (Chap. 2: The Farm), 32--56. The point of this reading (it's the fastest read for today) is to get a sense of the commoditization of corn and why it's so cheap now. And to compare the meaning of corn as discussed in the other readings with how it's portrayed in this chapter.
- Erick Castellanos and Sarah Bergstresser, "The Mexican and Transnational Lives of Corn: Technological, Political, Edible Object", in _Edible Identities_ (ed. Broulotte and Di Giovine), Taylor & Francis (2016), 201--216.


{% include alert.html class='info' title='Corn' text="
- Ever wonder what tassles are for?[This short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEmbOFsqld8) explains the reproduction and maturity of dent corn, the most common kind of corn grown in the US, mostly for animal feed. 
- The corn on the cob you like slathered with butter is sweet corn, and it reproduces the same way, but loses less moisture and (as you might guess) is sweeter. 
- The other kind of corn you like to eat has a non-porous hull. If you heat the kernel, the water in the kernel turns to steam, expands, and [turns inside out really slowly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSZd33awqQk), so you can munch on the now-puffy starchy interior.
"%}

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Weekly Reflection' text="
What we can we learn from this history of corn? Remember, provide specific examples from OUR readings/discussion!
"%}


## 5: Sep 16 + 18

### Sep 16: Early America, Food, and Households
- _HAE_, 33--55 (2: Food and the Founding). Continuing our thinking about food and identity, this chapter covers how capitalism and food were central to shaping early American identity. Both this chapter and the other reading emphasize the importance of capitalist markets, food production, and the development of cookbooks as a way of cultivating an American cuisine (and identity).
- Keith Stavely and Kathleen Fitzgerald, _America's Founding Food_ (4: Cookbooks and Commerce), 120--147. Even though not clearly marked, there are two distinct parts to this reading. 
  - SKIM BUT DON'T SKIP the first part (to 129), which explains the capitalist logic of food production in the late 1700s and early 1800s, and how central food was to economic growth. This is important background knowledge to have, but don't sweat the details.
  - The second part (129+) shows how early cookbooks start reflect the cultural changes underway during that time, and to some extent become drivers of those changes as well. 
  - This reading complements the _HAE_ reading with considerable more detail about the role of women in managing food, the household, and shaping American foodways.


### Sep 18: NO CLASS
{% include alert.html class='warning' title='NO CLASS TODAY!' text="
Upon further review, this article is not totally necessary given amount of reading for Tuesday. Also, next week will be a bit more work with your cookbook comparisons, so it's good to recharge beforehand.

- ORGINALLY: James E. McWilliams, \"How Unripe We Are\", _Food, Culture & Society_ 8.2 (2005): 143–60. This is still an excellent article to review for the cookbook assignment!

"%}


{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Reading Reflection' text="
The cost for canceling class on Thursday is a slightly longer reflection this week. ~500 words instead of the usual ~350. Sketch out the various ways food was used to create early American identity. This is important background to our cookbook assignment next week. Again, remember the goal of these reflections is to **show your familiarity with OUR readings and the arguments/evidence presented in them**.  
"%}



## 6: Sept 23 + 25

### Sep 23: History from Cookbooks
- Review the  [Cookbook Comparison Guide](cookbook-analysis) to get a sense of what we're working toward.
- Ken Albala, [Cookbooks as Historical Documents](https://www-oxfordhandbooks-com.libproxy.unm.edu/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199729937.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199729937-e-13). This highly skimmable chapter nicely lays out a process for interrogating cookbooks and reading in between the lines with many excellent examples.
- Barbara Ketcham Wheaton, "Cookbook as Resources for Social History". This chapter very nicely sketches out, with many diverse examples, how cookbooks function as windows onto history, including how and why they were used in the world. It has a much broader scope than Early U.S. History.

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Reading Quiz' text="
This one's about using cookbooks as historical sources.
"%}


### Sept 25: Early American Cookbook Contexts
- Keith Stavely and Kathleen Fitzgerald, _United Tastes: The Making of the First American Cookbook_ (2: Culinary Tradition), 29--51. This provides a fascinating cultural background of cookbooks and their evolution. Honestly the first few sentences of each paragraph will give you enough background.
- Rachel A. Snell, [As North American as Pumpkin Pie: Cookbooks and the Development of National Cuisine in North America, 1796-1854](https://www.erudit.org/fr/revues/cuizine/2014-v5-n2-cuizine01533/1026771ar/). This title is misleading, as the article is more about how cookbooks can be used to create a national identity more than a cuisine. And that's precisely why it's interesting and useful to us in thinking about how to read old cookbooks. The analysis here is a great example of what I hope you'll do (on a much smaller scale) with your own cookbooks.


#### Some cookbooks mentioned in the readings
- Amelia Simmons, [American Cookery](https://books.google.com/books?id=_6CggcPs3iQC). For more, see Harry Haff, _The Founders of American Cuisine: Seven Cookbook Authors, with Historical Recipes_ (2: Amelia Simmons), 21--33. This is a great example of how the author analyzes Simmons's cookbook, particularly the way the author comments on how explanation or ambiguities in the recipes reflect what readers would know or not know.
- Lydia Child, [American Frugal Housewife](https://books.google.com/books?id=D3AEAAAAYAAJ)
- Mary Randolph [The Virginia Housewife](https://books.google.com/books?id=R4YEAAAAYAAJ)
- Eliza Leslie, [Miss Leslie\'s Complete Cookery](https://books.google.com/books?id=KVL5oJA8IWsC)

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Cookbook comparison' text="
Post your [cookbook comparison](cookbook-analysis) by MONDAY NIGHT!
"%}



## 7: Sep 30 + Oct 2 

### Sep 30: Expansion and Immigration
- _HAE_, 57--87 (3: Expansion and Immigration).


### Oct 2: Restaurants as Agents of Change
- Samantha Barbas, “‘I’ll Take Chop Suey’: Restaurants as Agents of Culinary and Cultural Change”, _The Journal of Popular Culture_, 36.4 (2003): 669–86. As a complement to the _HAE_ chapter, this article vividly illustrates how a certain kind of cuisine is adopted, adapted, and transformed into the melting pot of American food. There is way more detail than we need here, but Barbas paints an intriguing portrait of the creation of Chinese American food, which I would say has been one of the most vibrant genres of cookbooks in the last few years.

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Reading Quiz' text="
This quiz focuses on instances when AND WHY food traditions were blending together and when they were remaining distinct. It would be useful to think about the differences in tone between _HAE_ and the Barbas article.
"%}



## 8: Fall Break

### Oct 7 AND Oct 9: FALL BREAK
NO CLASS! Make some good food. Argue about its authenticity. 



## 9: Oct 14 + 16
Welcome back! I hope you all had a nice break. 

We left off thinking about the diffusion of Chinese food via American dishes like chop suey in the late 1800s and early 1900s. We learned Chinese people were not as popular as their food (which can be said for most immigrant groups, I'd say), and we learned something about the process of culinary adaptation, diffusion, and the socialization of new cuisines. We continue that thread by looking at the diffusion of "southwestern cuisine".

### Oct 14: Southwest Diffusion
- Amy Bentley, "From Culinary Other to Mainstream America: Meanings and Uses of Southwestern Cuisine", in _Culinary Tourism_ (ed. Lucy M. Long), University Press of Kentucky (2013), 209--223. Aspects of this article will remind you of the chop suey article from last class before break---namely the transformation of foods once considered “foreign” or “inedible” into mainstream staples and how food can simultaneously express admiration for and dominance over another culture. I want to focus on the different ways in which southwestern food have become so culturally ubiquitous.
-Anastacia Uriegas, [Fajitas, Queso & Enchiladas: A Look at the Origins of Tex-Mex Favorites](https://remezcla.com/features/culture/fajitas-queso-enchiladas-look-origins-tex-mex-favorites/). This is a fun set of histories, but what kinds of key issues are left OUT in these tales?


{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Reading Reflection' text="
BASED ON THE READINGS: What does the history of food in the Southwest and its diffusion teach us about food, culture, and identity that we haven't exactly seen before? However much you interject your own opinion (and I hope you will!), please be sure your post addresses the prompt question and draws specifically from the readings this week!
"%}


### Oct 16: Nature + Technology 
Is anything more American than cereal for breakfast? Today  There are some fun, easy readings that provide some fun details about cereal that aren't super relevant for class discussion, but may appear on your quiz.

- _HAE_, 89--110 (Ch. 3: Technology and Taste).

#### Fun cereal history
Skim through these for some extra background for our discussion. Honestly, nothing essential but it's fun!
- Sarah Pruitt, "[How an Accidental Invention Changed What Americans Eat for Breakfast](https://www.history.com/news/cereal-breakfast-origins-kellogg)"
- Blake Hatton, [The Early Years of American Ready to Eat Breakfast Cereal: The Breakfast Cereal Revolution Until 1930](https://scalar.usc.edu/works/early-years-of-ready-to-eat-breakfast-cereal/index).
- Jaya Saxena, [How Cereal Became the Quintessential American Breakfast](https://www.seriouseats.com/2015/03/history-of-breakfast-cereal-mascots.html). Not much new historical information in this one, but it's really fun for for its focus on advertising and great images?.

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Weekly Reflection' text="
Connect the \"culinary other\" discussion with the food/technology discussion. It's possible, I promise.
"%}




## 10: Oct 21 + 23

### Oct 21: Nutrition, Economy, and Citizenship

{% include alert.html class='warning' title='NO CLASS' text="
Thanks to administrative responsibilities I can't get out of, there is no class today! But there still is a straightforward reading and quiz on it. Both are important to have doen BEFORE THURSDAY's CLASS. Technically the quiz is due Sunday like always, but please do it early this week.
"%}

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='READING QUIZ' text="
No class meeting today as noted, but there is an actual reading quiz to make sure we have the fundamentals of American food down for Thursday's discussion.
"%}

- Katherine Turner, _How the Other Half Ate_ (Ch. 1: The Problem of Food), ebook pp. 14--39. [[online through UNM](https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/unm/detail.action?docID=1574614)]. Not you can read the chapter online or download a PDF of the chapter (which I often find easier to display how I want). 

This book gives us excellent background on working-class life in the U.S. around 1900. There is way more detail than we need (but helps ground the analysis in specific examples as I'm always asking you to do), so be sure you're reading to grasp the big picture of who the working class are, how they eat, and what they value (and don't) in food.


### Oct 23: Scientific Moralization
- Charlotte Biltekoff, _Eating Right in America_ (Ch. 2: Scientific Moralization), 13--44. This reading illustrates how early nutritional scientists and social reformers tried to contain and order the chaos of diverse tastes, preferences, and eating habits of all the different people immigrating to the U.S. from the 1880s to the 1920s. The emphasis on dietary habits was a way of creating/maintaining a more consistent societal fabric. In the minds of social reformers, there was too much cultural and culinary diversity; the country needed a standard way of eating to make a stronger and more unified, more civilized bodies of citizens. Note how this is somewhat contrary to the blending/adaptation narrative we've read about at times with respect to various food traditions. Biltekoff claims that all dietary advice has a strong moral component to it. 


{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Reading Reflection' text="
To what extent to you agree with Biltekoff that \"all dietary advice is _necessarily_ moral\"? Isn't science and nutrition objective? As always, there's no \"right\" answer here; I just want to see you engaging with her argument and evidence.
"%}




## 11: Oct 28 + 30


### Oct 28: Americanizing Diets
- Helen Zoe Veit, _Modern Food, Moral Food_ (6: Americanizing the American Diet), 123--56.

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='READING QUIZ' text="
The usual. Whatever that is at this point.
"%}


### Oct 30: Food festivals, archives, and stories 🎃 
- David Foster Wallace, "Consider the Lobster"
- Something on food archives
- Food stories assignment overview



## 12: Nov 4 + 6

### Nov 4: Beef 🥩
- Joshua Specht, [The price of plenty: how beef changed America](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/may/07/the-price-of-plenty-how-beef-changed-america)



### Nov 6: Chicken 🍗 
- Emeyln Rude, _Tastes like Chicken_, 6--11; 27--39; 130--134; 141--160; 181--192. 
  - Sorry for all the partial sections here, but the PDF is just the pages you need to read (the book goes off on many cool tangents, which obscures the big picture). 
  - This looks like a crazy amount of reading, but there are not many words per page; many pages are recipes that you can skip over. It goes by fast, and it's a fun non-academic read.

## 15: Thanksgiving week
Just one meeting this week, and we're going back in time a little to examine the historical construction of Thanksgiving. Lots of ideas for the dinner table!

### Nov 25: T-day mythology
- Philip Deloria, “[The Invention of Thanksgiving](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/11/25/the-invention-of-thanksgiving)”, _New Yorker_, 95.37 (November 25, 2019): 70--74. [Also in Zotero if the link doesn't work.]
- Janet Siskind, “The Invention of Thanksgiving: A Ritual of American Nationality", 167--91.
- [First Thanksgiving Menu](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/what-was-on-the-menu-at-the-first-thanksgiving-511554/). This quick read serves two purposes: it's a nice overview of what food were likely available at the harvest celebration of 1621. And it's a good example of uncritical food history that focuses entirely on food without much of the historical context (neither in the 1600s or 1900s).
