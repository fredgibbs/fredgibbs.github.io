# Schedule of Readings & Assignments

## General suggestions
- Regular bullet points listed under each day is what you need to READ FOR THAT DAY.
- Readings are listed in a particular order that I think works best.
- All readings that aren't directly linked to are in [our Zotero Library](https://www.zotero.org/groups/2499167/american-food-unm/library). See the syllabus home page for instructions on gaining access.
- All posted assignments are technically due on the day they are listed so that we all stay on schedule, but they can be submitted up to 9am on the following day. Be sure you are familiar with policies in the "Submitting Work" section on the syllabus home page.


## Colored boxes
{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Red boxes' text="
These indicate something you have to DO or TURN IN.
"%}

{% include alert.html class='warning' title='Yellow Boxes' text="
These indicate something you should be aware of---usually an upcoming assignment or a longer reading---but isn't anything you need to immediately do.
"%}

{% include alert.html class='info' title='Blue boxes' text="
These indicate something that is important to know, but isn't time sensitive.

### Video lectures
All video lectures will be posted on the [course YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeiHxkIHW5kM1hqofknf2ig), and I will link to them on the syllabus as they become available. If you want announcements of new videos, please subscribe to the channel.


### Noteworthy is optional
Most days have a "noteworthy" section that lists a few relevant readings on the topic. These are optional! Most have some good ideas that I'll mention in the videos; others are there just for additional materials and extra credit opportunities. I hope you'll skim through any that seem interesting to you and mention them in your work so you can get extra credit for that work.



# Week 1

## Jun 6

### Course introductions
Our task for today is to make sure you know how the course is structured and general expectations.

- [VIDEO: Course Intro, Syllabus Intro, and Why I like food](https://youtu.be/w4WJ5wmduY8)
- Warren Belasco, "Why study food?", from _Food: The Key Concepts_, 1--13.


{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Syllabus quiz' text="
This will cover the course intro video, the syllabus, and the short Belasco reading.
"%}

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Introductory post' text="
Just to make sure everyone is connected, and as an informal way of introducing ourselves, please post on the Canvas Discussion Board (should be an obvious link on the left nav bar on the Canvas course page) a brief introduction and one of your most vivid food memories---and why it resonates with you. These should be ~150 words or so. Please REPLY to the previous post (I've already put one there as a starter) so that we get one continuous thread---that makes reading through them MUCH easier.

Remember that all work, including these introductions, are due on the the day they are listed on the syllabus---that's today (= by 9am tomorrow)!

### Challenges and Rewards of Food + History
I think this whole course makes more sense when you understand how and why people study food the way they do. So that's what the lecture is about, complemented by the Haley reading that argues we should resist the urge to romanticize the culinary past as is so often done in food media. A) It's never that simple and B) the real history is far more interesting and revealing.

- Andrew P. Haley, "The Nation before Taste: The Challenges of American Culinary History", _The Public Historian_ 34.2 (2012): 53--78.
- [VIDEO: How and why to do food history](https://youtu.be/BWFMOiorPqg)

#### Noteworthy

## Jun 8

### National Cuisine & American Food
The goal for today is to complicate the idea of "American" food through an investigation of national cuisine generally and ways of thinking about it. There are an unusually high number of readings for today, but they are all quite short!  

- [VIDEO: Ideas and questions to keep in mind; first reflection advice](https://youtu.be/TscBrPzkGto)
- _HAE_, xi--xv. _HAE_ refers to _How America Eats_ as described on the syllabus home page. You can access it for [free through UNM Libraries](https://unm-worldcat-org.libproxy.unm.edu/title/how-america-eats-a-social-history-of-us-food-and-culture/oclc/794361344&referer=brief_results).
- Alison K. Smith, [National Cuisines](https://www-oxfordhandbooks-com.libproxy.unm.edu/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199729937.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199729937-e-25), from _The Oxford Handbook of Food History_ (2012). You can read more quickly over the long Russia example if you want, as the details don't much as the general ideas introduced earlier on. But do read the last paragraph! This is definitely the driest of the readings for this week, but it introduces a number of useful concepts to keep in mind as moving through the other readings.
- _Mind of Chef_: [Ed Lee on American Food](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5DZui1nrAs)
- Ruth Tobias, [Is There Such a Thing as ‘American’ Food?](https://www.tastingtable.com/culture/national/defining-american-food-cuisine). This article touches on culinary/cultural appropriation, which is a topic we cover in some depth in a few weeks, so focus for no
- Sidney Mintz, "Eating American". This is easily the most controversial piece this week, suggesting there is no such thing as American Cuisine. Pay attention to his arguments so you can craft a thoughtful reading reflection for this week.


#### Noteworthy
- Sean Wyer, [Italy isn't Eatalty](https://vittles.substack.com/p/italy-isnt-eataly). The title and conclusion of this article relate the unsurprising point that the cuisine of an entire nation can't be captured in a giant upscale grocery store. We hardly need to article to explain that to us, but the author makes a number of good points about how to think about national cuisine.


{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Reading reflection' text="
1. make sure you're familiar with the [reading reflection guide](reading-reflections).
2. Drawing from ALL the readings: What are the most useful ideas for thinking about national cuisine that you noted? Can a national cuisine be defined by its diversity (as Lee and Tobias suggest)? Or does such diversity mean there really isn't an American cuisine (as Mintz suggests)? Is it OK if there is no such thing as American cuisine? Does the difficulty of defining a national cuisine complicate the idea of national identity in general?
"%}



## Jun 9

### Authenticity
Almost everyone thinks about whether some kind of food or dish is "authentic" from time to time. But what does that really mean? The few readings for today should help us think more carefully notions of authenticity---particularly how it's paradoxically an entirely superficial way of describing food, but still a very powerful one.

- [VIDEO: National cuisine and authentic food](https://youtu.be/qqiNJx3mS8c)
- Dwight Furrow, _American Foodie_ (7: Habits and Heresies: Authenticity, Food Rules, and Traditions), 133--48.
- Kevin Alexander, [Why Authentic Food is Bullshit](https://www.thrillist.com/eat/nation/why-authentic-food-is-bullshit)

#### Noteworthy
- Sara Kay, [Yelp Reviewers’ Authenticity Fetish Is White Supremacy in Action](https://ny.eater.com/2019/1/18/18183973/authenticity-yelp-reviews-white-supremacy-trap).
- Rachel Laudan, [Desperately Seeking Authenticity](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2001-dec-19-fo-16368-story.html)
- Matthew Strohl, ‘On Culinary Authenticity’, _The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism_, 77.2 (2019), 157--67.


{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Reading reflection' text="
These readings give us some new perspectives on the idea of authenticity and cast some (if not significant) doubt on the value of the concept. Your prompt for today asks you to put the readings in conversation with each other. Alexander's article is provocative and fun and sometimes smart, but what does it miss compared to Furrow's article?
"%}



## Jun 10
### Cuisines of Contact & Thanksgiving
- NO VIDEO
- _HAE_, 1--10 (from 1: Cuisine of Contact).
- Philip Deloria, “[The Invention of Thanksgiving](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/11/25/the-invention-of-thanksgiving)”, _New Yorker_, 95.37 (November 25, 2019): 70--74. [Also in Zotero if the link doesn't work.]
- Janet Siskind, “The Invention of Thanksgiving: A Ritual of American Nationality", 167--91.
- [First Thanksgiving Menu](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/what-was-on-the-menu-at-the-first-thanksgiving-511554/). This quick read serves two purposes: it's a nice overview of what food were likely available at the harvest celebration of 1621. And it's a good example of uncritical food history that focuses entirely on food without much of the historical context (neither in the 1600s or 1900s).


{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Readings Quiz' text="
This quiz covers basics from the readings, but also has a few short answer questions about the various myths and meanings associated with Thanksgiving. How much does Thanksgiving reflect both nationalism (of some people) and marginalization (of other people)?

# Week 2

## Jun 13
###  On Cuisines and Corn
- [Overview VIDEO; small changes; quiz tips; why the set of readings for today)](https://youtu.be/zRz17bvrWLQ)
- _HAE_, 13--31 (from 1: Cuisine of Contact).
- Keith Stavely and Kathleen Fitzgerald, _America's Founding Food_ (1: This Beautifull Noble Eare), read 4--15 and 45--48 more carefully; skim (but don't skip) 15--45 on the various dishes. Nothing about particular dishes will be on the quiz, but expect to explain why such descriptions are there. HINT: It has something to do with how dishes move across cultures (but you'll want to be able to elaborate on that point in your reply).
- Erick Castellanos and Sarah Bergstresser, "The Mexican and Transnational Lives of Corn: Technological, Political, Edible Object", in _Edible Identities_ (ed. Broulotte and Di Giovine), Taylor & Francis (2016), 201--216.


#### Noteworthy
- Michael Pollan, _Omnivore's Dilemma_, (Chap. 2: The Farm), 32--56. The point of this reading (it's the fastest read for today) is to get a sense of the commoditization of corn and why it's so cheap now. And to compare the meaning of corn as discussed in the other readings with how it's portrayed in this chapter.
- [Ever wonder what tassles are for?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEmbOFsqld8) This explains the reproduction and maturity of dent corn, the most common kind of corn grown in the US, mostly for animal feed. The corn on the cob you like slathered with butter is sweet corn, and it reproduces the same way, but loses less moisture and is, as you might guess, sweeter. The other kind of corn you like to eat is popcorn, which has a non-porous hull. If you heat the kernel, the water in the kernel turns to steam, expands, and [turns inside out really slowly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSZd33awqQk), so you can munch on the starchy interior.

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Reading Quiz' text="
This quiz covers early food consumption in early America, how food and personal/community/national identity were intertwined (as we see in attitudes about corn) and how meanings of food can be utterly transformed over time, as outlined in the Castellanos and Bergstresser article.

## Jun 14
### Early America, Cookbooks, and National Identity
- NO VIDEO
- _HAE_, 33--55 (2: Food and the Founding). Continuing our emphasis on food and identity, this chapter covers how food was central to shaping early American identity. Both this chapter and the other reading emphaize the importance of capitalist markets, food production, and the development of cookbooks as a way of cultivating an American cuisine (and identity).
- Keith Stavely and Kathleen Fitzgerald, _America's Founding Food_ (4: Cookbooks and Commerce), 120--147. Even though not clearly marked, there are really two distinct parts to this reading. The first part (to 129) is very helpful in understanding capitalist logic of food production in the late 1700s and early 1800s. The second part shows how early cookbooks start reflect the cultural changes underway during that time. Both complement the _HAE_ reading with considerable more detail about the role of women in managing food, the household, and shaping American foodways. Pay attention to the SECTION HEADINGS! The reading is a bit dry and it can be easy to loose track of the main points, but if you keep relating the paragraphs and ideas back to the section headings, things will make more sense.


#### Noteworthy
- James E. McWilliams, “‘How Unripe We Are’”, _Food, Culture & Society_ 8.2 (2005): 143–60.


{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Reading Reflection' text="
On the survey, about 3/4 people wanted actual prompt questions to respond to, and roughly 1/4 preferred open-ended prompts to relay what they learned and/or found interesting. Since all our other prompts have been specific questions (and you have a more specific cookbook analysis due Thursday), we have a general one for today.

PROMPT: What did you learn from the reading today? Remember the goal of these reflections is to show your familiarity with the readings---BOTH of them, as they are quite distinct. The more you can describe, the higher your score will be, so you should aim to cover a range of topics that are prominent in the readings. The reading descriptions above might help you identify key themes that are worth elaborating on.

### Cookbooks as historical sources
- [VIDEO: brief recap and cookbook analysis highlights](https://youtu.be/nCpazETMY6M)
The below readings will help you do the upcoming [Cookbook Analysis](cookbook-analysis) assignment. To keep you honest, there is a short quiz on how to use cookbooks as historical sources based on the readings for today.

- Ken Albala, [Cookbooks as Historical Documents](https://www-oxfordhandbooks-com.libproxy.unm.edu/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199729937.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199729937-e-13). This chapter, although a bit long, very nicely lays out a process for interrogating cookbooks and reading in between the lines with many excellent examples. The questions and methods described in the article are exactly what you be doing with your own [cookbook analysis](cookbook-analysis) due tomorrow.
- Harry Haff, _The Founders of American Cuisine: Seven Cookbook Authors, with Historical Recipes_ (2: Amelia Simmons), 21--33. Note in particular how the author analyzes Simmons's cookbook. This is what you'll be doing for your assignment.


#### Noteworthy
- Barbara Ketcham Wheaton, "Cookbook as Resources for Social History". This chapter very nicely sketches out, with many diverse examples, how cookbooks function as windows onto history, including how and why they were used in the world.

- Keith Stavely and Kathleen Fitzgerald, _United Tastes: The Making of the First American Cookbook_ (2: Culinary Tradition), 29--51. This provides a fascinating cultural background of cookbooks and their evolution. Honestly the first few sentences of each paragraph will give you enough background.
- Colleen Cotter, "Claiming a Piece of the Pie", 51--68.
- Jane C. Busch, "Using Cookbooks as Research Documents", 22--25.

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Reading reflection' text="
Personally, I find most culinary appropriation conversations to be unhelpfully superficial. It is pointless to debate whether culinary/cultural appropriation actually happens (it does), or whether it's just some people being overly sensitive (it is), or whether it can be an (inadvertent) tool of marginalization (it can). These are non-debatable facts. What matters for today is how we can learn to think and talk about appropriation in a sufficiently nuanced way that encourages innovation and adaptation while respecting cultural meanings.

Use the articles for this week to evaluate a claim we read a few weeks ago from Ruth Tobias ([here](https://www.tastingtable.com/culture/national/defining-american-food-cuisine)): \"The difference between adaptation and appropriation is one of privilege--the privilege to control and inevitably whitewash the narrative surrounding a given dish.\" How is this statement correct? How is it wrong? How does food history we've been learning offer a possible solution to the legitimate but sometimes overblown concerns about appropriation?

The book tends to go off on lots of cool tangents, so we skip around to stay on topic.
