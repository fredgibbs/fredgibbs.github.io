# Schedule of Readings & Assignments


### Due dates
All posted assignments are technically "due" on the day they are listed so that we all stay on schedule. An occasional late post is fine. Repeatedly late posts will negatively impact your grade, as your score decreases by one point per day. After a week, you get a zero. The course simply moves too quickly for much flexibility with deadlines.

### Video lectures
All video lectures will be posted on the [course YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeiHxkIHW5kM1hqofknf2ig), and I will link to them on the syllabus as they become available. If you want announcements of new videos, please subscribe to the channel.

### Read/watch in order
I list the readings/videos in the order I think it will be most useful to you. Usually, the earlier readings (or videos) introduce some ideas that get elaborated on in later readings. Going out of order can make things much more confusing, but of course you're free to work through the readings however you wish.

### Noteworthy is optional
Most days have a "noteworthy" section that lists a few relevant readings on the topic. These are optional! Most have some good ideas that I'll mention in the videos; others are there just for additional materials and extra credit opportunities. I hope you'll skim through any that seem interesting to you (and I hope you'll mention them in your posts so you can get credit for that work).

### All non-linked reading assignments are in Zotero
Remember that if there isn't a direct link to a reading, it's in our course Zotero library. Instructions are on the [syllabus home page](index) under `Readings and Books`.


# Week 1

## Jun 7

### Course introductions
Our task for today is to make sure you know how the course is structured and general expectations.

- [VIDEO: Course Intro, Syllabus Intro, and Why I like food](https://youtu.be/w4WJ5wmduY8)
- Warren Belasco, "Why study food?", from _Food: The Key Concepts_, 1--13. Note the last couple pages are about eating meat (and seems a bit shaded against it, IMO). But Belasco misses a couple major points when talking about both the benefits and consequences of eating meat. On the quiz for today, plan to articulate what you think he is **not** addressing---but should---in that section. Hint: Does it have anything to do with his definition of "meat"?


{% include alert.html class='warning' title='Syllabus quiz' text="
This will cover the course into video, the syllabus, and the short Belasco reading.
"%}

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Introductory post' text="
Just to make sure everyone is connected, and as an informal way of introducing ourselves, please post on the class Discussion Board in UNM Learn (should be an obvious link on the left nav bar in Learn) a brief introduction and one of your most vivid food memories---and why it resonates with you. These should be ~150 words or so. Please REPLY to the previous post (I've already put one there as a starter) so that we get one continuous thread---that makes reading through them MUCH easier.

Remember that all work, including these introductions, are due on the the day they are listed on the syllabus---that's today!

## Jun 8

### Challenges and Rewards of Food + History
I think this whole course makes more sense when you understand how and why people study food the way they do. So that's what the lecture is about, complemented by the Haley reading that argues we should resist the urge to romanticize the culinary past as is so often done in food media. A) It's never that simple and B) the real history is far more interesting and revealing.

- Andrew P. Haley, "The Nation before Taste: The Challenges of American Culinary History", _The Public Historian_ 34.2 (2012): 53--78.
- [VIDEO: How and why to do food history](https://youtu.be/BWFMOiorPqg)

#### Noteworthy
- G. J. Fitzgerald and G. M. Petrick, "In Good Taste: Rethinking American History with Our Palates", _Journal of American History_ 95.2 (2008): 392--404.

{% include alert.html class='warning' title='Lecture and Reading Quiz' text="
This will cover the lecture and the Haley reading.

## Jun 9

### National Cuisine & American Food
The goal for today is to complicate the idea of "American" food through an investigation of national cuisine generally and ways of thinking about it. There are an unusually high number of readings for today, but they are all quite short!  

- [VIDEO: Ideas and questions to keep in mind; first reflection advice](https://youtu.be/TscBrPzkGto)
- _HAE_, xi--xv. _HAE_ refers to _How America Eats_ as described on the syllabus home page. You can access it for [free through UNM Libraries](https://unm-worldcat-org.libproxy.unm.edu/title/how-america-eats-a-social-history-of-us-food-and-culture/oclc/794361344&referer=brief_results).
- _Mind of Chef_: [Ed Lee on American Food](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5DZui1nrAs)
- Alison K. Smith, [National Cuisines](https://www-oxfordhandbooks-com.libproxy.unm.edu/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199729937.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199729937-e-25), from _The Oxford Handbook of Food History_ (2012). You can read more quickly over the long Russia example if you want, as the details don't much as the general ideas introduced earlier on. But do read the last paragraph! This is definitely the driest of the readings for this week, but it introduces a number of useful concepts to keep in mind as moving through the other readings.
- Sean Wyer, [Italy isn't Eatalty](https://vittles.substack.com/p/italy-isnt-eataly). The title and conclusion of this article relate the unsurprising point that the cuisine of an entire nation can't be captured in a giant upscale grocery store. We hardly need to article to explain that to us, but the author makes a number of good points about how to think about national cuisine.
- Ruth Tobias, [Is There Such a Thing as ‘American’ Food?](https://www.tastingtable.com/culture/national/defining-american-food-cuisine). This article touches on culinary/cultural appropriation, which is a topic we cover in some depth in a few weeks, so focus for no
- Sidney Mintz, "Eating American". This is easily the most controversial piece this week, suggesting there is no such thing as American Cuisine. Pay attention to his arguments so you can craft a thoughtful reading reflection for this week.

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Reading reflection' text="
1. make sure you're familiar with the [reading reflection guide](reading-reflections).
2. DRAWING FROM THE SET OF READINGS: What are the most useful ideas for thinking about national cuisine that you noted? Can a national cuisine be defined by its diversity (as Lee and Tobias suggest)? Or does such diversity mean there really isn't an American cuisine (as Mintz suggests), and would that be OK? Does the difficulty of defining a national cuisine complicate the idea of national identity in general? Or in other words, does thinking about American cuisine help us understand the idea of \"Americanness\"?
3. Don't forget your 1-2 THOUGHTFUL questions at the end that I can address in the next video. See the [reading reflection guide](reading-reflections) for more.
"%}



## Jun 10

### Authenticity
Almost everyone thinks about whether some kind of food or dish is authentic from time to time. But what does that really mean? The few readings for today should help us think more carefully about why we do that and how useful it is. And most importantly, how we can do it more effectively.

- [VIDEO: Overlap between national cuisine and authentic food and ideas for your reflections](https://youtu.be/qqiNJx3mS8c)
- Dwight Furrow, _American Foodie_ (7: Habits and Heresies: Authenticity, Food Rules, and Traditions), 133--48.
- Kevin Alexander, [Why Authentic Food is Bullshit](https://www.thrillist.com/eat/nation/why-authentic-food-is-bullshit)

#### Noteworthy
- Sara Kay, [Yelp Reviewers’ Authenticity Fetish Is White Supremacy in Action](https://ny.eater.com/2019/1/18/18183973/authenticity-yelp-reviews-white-supremacy-trap).
- Rachel Laudan, [Desperately Seeking Authenticity](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2001-dec-19-fo-16368-story.html)
- Matthew Strohl, ‘On Culinary Authenticity’, _The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism_, 77.2 (2019), 157--67.


{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Reading reflection' text="
These readings give us some new perspectives on the idea of authenticity and cast some (if not significant) doubt on the value of the concept. Drawing from BOTH readings: How is it useful? How is it not? Alexander's article is provocative and fun and sometimes smart. Would it be even better if it incorporated more of Furrow's ideas (and nuance generally)? Or is it better to take a hard line on the topic as he does?
"%}



## Jun 11 (Fri)
### Cuisines of Contact & Thanksgiving
- NO VIDEO TODAY
- _HAE_, 1--10 (from 1: Cuisine of Contact).
- Janet Siskind, “The Invention of Thanksgiving: A Ritual of American Nationality", 167--91.
- [First Thanksgiving Menu](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/what-was-on-the-menu-at-the-first-thanksgiving-511554/). This quick read serves two purposes: it's a nice overview of what food were likely available at the harvest celebration of 1621. And it's a good example of uncritical food history that focuses entirely on food without much of the historical context (neither in the 1600s or 1900s).

#### Noteworthy
- Philip Deloria, “The Invention of Thanksgiving”, _New Yorker_, 95.37 (November 25, 2019): 70--74.


{% include alert.html class='warning' title='Readings Quiz' text="
This quiz covers basics from the readings, but also has a few short answer questions about the various myths and meanings associated with Thanksgiving. How much does Thanksgiving reflect both nationalism (of some people) and marginalization (of other people)?

# Week 2

## Jun 14
###  On Cuisines and Corn
- [Overview VIDEO; small changes; quiz tips; why the set of readings for today)](https://youtu.be/zRz17bvrWLQ)
- _HAE_, 13--31 (from 1: Cuisine of Contact).
- Keith Stavely and Kathleen Fitzgerald, _America's Founding Food_ (1: This Beautifull Noble Eare), read 4--15 and 45--48 more carefully; skim (but don't skip) 15--45 on the various dishes. Nothing about particular dishes will be on the quiz, but I will ask why such descriptions are there, so look for those bits in the pages you're skimming. HINT: It has something to do with how dishes move across cultures (but you'll want to be able to elaborate on that point in your reply).
- Michael Pollan, _Omnivore's Dilemma_, (Chap. 2: The Farm), 32--56. The point of this reading (it's the fastest read for today) is to get a sense of the commoditization of corn and why it's so cheap now. And to compare the meaning of corn as discussed in the other readings with how it's portrayed in this chapter.

#### Noteworthy
- Erick Castellanos and Sarah Bergstresser, "The Mexican and Transnational Lives of Corn: Technological, Political, Edible Object", in _Edible Identities_ (ed. Broulotte and Di Giovine), Taylor & Francis (2016), 201--216.
- [Ever wonder what tassles are for?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEmbOFsqld8) This explains the reproduction and maturity of dent corn, the most common kind of corn grown in the US, mostly for animal feed. The corn on the cob you like slathered with butter is sweet corn, and it reproduces the same way, but loses less moisture and is, as you might guess, sweeter. The other kind of corn you like to eat is popcorn, which has a non-porous hull. If you heat the kernel, the water in the kernel turns to steam, expands, and [turns inside out really slowly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSZd33awqQk), so you can munch on the starchy interior.

{% include alert.html class='warning' title='Reading Quiz' text="
This quiz covers early food consumption in early America, how food and personal/community/national identity were intertwined (as we see in attitudes about corn) and how meanings of food can be utterly transformed over time. It will also ask you about the main points of the Pollan article, but nothing specific, so just read for the big picture.
"%}



## Jun 15
### Early America, Early Food, Cookbooks, and National Identity
- NO VIDEO
- _HAE_, 33--55 (2: Food and the Founding). Continuing our emphasis on food and identity, this chapter covers how food was central to shaping early American identity. Both this chapter and the other reading emphaize the importance of capitalist markets, food production, and the development of cookbooks as a way of cultivating an American cuisine (and identity).
- Keith Stavely and Kathleen Fitzgerald, _America's Founding Food_ (4: Cookbooks and Commerce), 120--147. Even though not clearly marked, there are really two distinct parts to this reading. The first part (to 129) is very helpful in understanding capitalist logic of food production in the late 1700s and early 1800s. The second part shows how early cookbooks start reflect the cultural changes underway during that time. Both complement the _HAE_ reading with considerable more detail about the role of women in managing food, the household, and shaping American foodways. Pay attention to the SECTION HEADINGS! The reading is a bit dry and it can be easy to loose track of the main points, but if you keep relating the paragraphs and ideas back to the section headings, things will make more sense.


#### Noteworthy
- James E. McWilliams, “‘How Unripe We Are’”, _Food, Culture & Society_ 8.2 (2005): 143–60.


{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Reading Reflection' text="
On the survey, about 3/4 people wanted actual prompt questions to respond to, and roughly 1/4 preferred open-ended prompts to relay what they learned and/or found interesting. Since all our other prompts have been specific questions (and you have a more specific cookbook analysis due Thursday), we have a general one for today.

PROMPT: What did you learn from the reading today? Remember the goal of these reflections is to show your familiarity with the readings---BOTH of them, as they are quite distinct. The more you can describe, the higher your score will be, so you should aim to cover a range of topics that are prominent in the readings. The reading descriptions above might help you identify key themes that are worth elaborating on.

### Cookbooks as historical sources
- [VIDEO: brief recap and cookbook analysis highlights](https://youtu.be/nCpazETMY6M)
The below readings will help you do the upcoming [Cookbook Analysis](cookbook-analysis) assignment. So read them with USING them in mind, not for writing a response about them. UPDATE 6/15: There is NO QUIZ for today as originally planned. We've been working hard enough---let's just focus on learning how to do the assignment.

- Rachel A. Snell, [As North American as Pumpkin Pie: Cookbooks and the Development of National Cuisine in North America, 1796-1854](https://www.erudit.org/fr/revues/cuizine/2014-v5-n2-cuizine01533/1026771ar/).
- Ken Albala, [Cookbooks as Historical Documents](https://www-oxfordhandbooks-com.libproxy.unm.edu/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199729937.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199729937-e-13). This chapter, although a bit long, very nicely lays out a process for interrogating cookbooks and reading in between the lines with many excellent examples. The questions and methods described in the article are exactly what you be doing with your own [cookbook analysis](cookbook-analysis) due tomorrow.


#### Noteworthy
- Barbara Ketcham Wheaton, "Cookbook as Resources for Social History". This chapter very nicely sketches out, with many diverse examples, how cookbooks function as windows onto history, including how and why they were used in the world.
- Keith Stavely and Kathleen Fitzgerald, _United Tastes: The Making of the First American Cookbook_ (2: Culinary Tradition), 29--51. This provides a fascinating cultural background of cookbooks and their evolution. Honestly the first few sentences of each paragraph will give you enough background.
- Harry Haff, _The Founders of American Cuisine: Seven Cookbook Authors, with Historical Recipes_ (2: Amelia Simmons), 21--33. Note in particular how the author analyzes Simmons's cookbook. This is what you'll be doing for your assignment.
- Colleen Cotter, "Claiming a Piece of the Pie", 51--68.
- Jane C. Busch, "Using Cookbooks as Research Documents", 22--25.

#### Some cookbooks mentioned in the readings
- Amelia Simmons, [American Cookery](https://books.google.com/books?id=_6CggcPs3iQC)
- Lydia Child, [American Frugal Housewife](https://books.google.com/books?id=D3AEAAAAYAAJ)

- Eliza Leslie, [Miss Leslie\'s Complete Cookery](https://books.google.com/books?id=KVL5oJA8IWsC)

{% include alert.html class='warning' title='No Quiz' text="
Originally we were going to have a quiz to highlight and emphasize some ideas from the readings about HOW to use cookbooks as historical sources. On second (actually fourth or fifth) thought, we don't need a quiz to test if you're ready for the assignment---that will be clear from the cookbook analysis itself. Instead of the usual reading reflection rubric, we will use one that more specifically addresses the methods covered in the readings and video.

### Health, Technology, and Cereal
Not much reading today, but an interesting early connection between health and technology that still influences our food choices.
- _HAE_, 143--55 (6: Pious and Patriotic Stomach).
- [VIDEO: Cereal, Health, Technology, Nature](https://youtu.be/x1jQ8aIfbLY). Sorry again for the long delay with this and the quiz! As I'm publishing the video, I see Learn is now unavailable as I'm trying to publish the quiz. When it rains, it pours! As soon as I can get into Learn, I will make the quiz available (I try to publish quizzes after the videos to make sure I don't have questions that got edited out).

## Jun 23
### Scientific Moralization
Today's topic builds directly off the lecture from last week on cereal and the coupling of moral and dietary advice---and how that continued even as the science of nutrition developed in the later 1800s and early 1900s. Nutrition provided the perfect scientific cover for telling immigrants how they should eat and be more American in their food and moral choices. This is obviously building on our recent readings on immigration and culinary diffusion as well.

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Reading reflection' text="
Personally, I find most culinary appropriation conversations to be unhelpfully superficial. It is pointless to debate whether culinary/cultural appropriation actually happens (it does), or whether it's just some people being overly sensitive (it is), or whether it can be an (inadvertent) tool of marginalization (it can). These are non-debateable facts. So what are debates about culinary appropriation really about?

Use the articles for this week to evaluate a claim we read a few weeks ago from Ruth Tobias ([here](https://www.tastingtable.com/culture/national/defining-american-food-cuisine)): \"The difference between adaptation and appropriation is one of privilege--the privilege to control and inevitably whitewash the narrative surrounding a given dish.\" How is this statement correct? How is it wrong? How does food history we've been learning offer a possible solution to the legitimate but sometimes overblown concerns about appropriation? BE SURE YOU USE THE READINGS TO SUPPORT YOUR ANSWER!

## Jun 30
### Natural Diets
- VIDEO: Natural diet; natural meat. Many ideological choices are reflected in how people eat or avoid meat. Some discussions about meat focus on the morality of eating other animals, some on potential health advantages, some on environmental impact. One can make moral arguments either way, or find "scientific" studies supporting just about any position, but often the decision comes down to whether one thinks eating meat is natural or not. Building on the history from yesterday, this lecture looks at the history of what constitutes a natural diet, including eating meat. The point isn't to say it's right or wrong (I have my opinion; you have yours), but to see how constructions of naturalness can be powerful influencers of food choice and debates.

### Noteworthy for lecture (but not required reading)

ALSO: Start drafting your [Final Course Reflection](final-course-reflection). These are TECHNICALLY due SATURDAY (the official last day of the 1H period), but everyone has some extra time UNTIL MONDAY to make it nice. You can of course submit it whenever you'd like.

## July 3 (Saturday)
Your FINAL Learning Reflection---over the WHOLE CLASS---is officially due today (the last official day of the 1H session.) However, feel free to revise and submit it MONDAY. See the [Final Course Reflection Guide](final-course-reflection). I can't emphasize enough that this SHOULD NOT BE MERELY A SUMMARY of what we've covered. Instead, as the instructions explain in more detail, illustrate how your thinking about food has changed over the month, and how your submitted work justifies what you think should be your overall grade for the course.
