# Schedule of Readings & Assignments

## Due dates
All posted assignments are technically "due" on the day they are listed so that we all stay on schedule. But you always have a one day grace period to submit your post without it being considered late. The grace period should be something you use a safety net for when shit happens, which it will. The course will be much easier if you're doing your readings and postings on the day listed on the syllabus.

## Video lectures and instructional videos
All mini-lectures (of which are less mini than is ideal) and other instructions about assignments are posted on the YouTube channel, and I will post an announcement and send an email about them via UNM Learn when they become available.



# Week 1

## Jun 1

### Introductions

{% include alert.html class='info' title='Mini-lecture' text='
### Introduction to the course and syllabus
'%}


{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Syllabus/intro video quiz' text="
First, watch the [introductory video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axHN2TC1Lyk). Then, visit UNM Learn, and find the `quizzes` link on the left nav.
"%}

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Introductory post' text="
Just to make sure everyone is connected, and as an informal way of introducing ourselves, please post on the class Discussion Board in UNM Learn (should be an obvious link on the left nav bar) a brief introduction to who you are and one of your most vivid food memories---and why it resonates with you. These should be ~150-200 words or so. PLEASE DO THIS BY THE END OF MONDAY, JUNE 1!
"%}



## Jun 2

### National Cuisine & American Food
- _HAE_, xi-xv.
- Sidney Mintz, "Eating American".
- _Mind of Chef_: [Ed Lee on American Food](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5DZui1nrAs)
- Browse a few essays from [here](https://blogs.brown.edu/amst-1906p-s01-spring-2017/), and find one interesting point you agree with and one you don't. There are no right answers in any of the essays, but many great ideas we should keep in mind throughout the course. Please pick one of the substantive essays to browse, not the introduction or conclusion essays.

{% include alert.html class='info' title='Mini-lecture: Why Care About Food & Taste?' text='
- Warren Belasco, "Why study food?", from _Food: The Key Concepts_ (Oxford University Press, 2008): 1--13.
- Andrew P. Haley, "The Nation before Taste: The Challenges of American Culinary History", _The Public Historian_ 34.2 (2012): 53--78.
- G. J. Fitzgerald and G. M. Petrick, "In Good Taste: Rethinking American History with Our Palates", _Journal of American History_ 95.2 (2008): 392--404.
'%}


{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Why study food quiz' text="
Visit UNM Learn, and find the `quizzes` link on the left nav.
"%}

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Reading response' text="
First, consult the [reading response guide](reading-responses). In addition to the generic questions listed there: What arguments seemed most interesting or ridiculous about what constitutes American food?
"%}




## Jun 3

## Authenticity
- Rachel Laudan, [Desperately Seeking Authenticity](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2001-dec-19-fo-16368-story.html)
- Dwight Furrow, _American Foodie_ (7: Habits and Heresies: Authenticity, Food Rules, and Traditions), 133-48.
- Sara Kay, [Yelp Reviewers’ Authenticity Fetish Is White Supremacy in Action](https://ny.eater.com/2019/1/18/18183973/authenticity-yelp-reviews-white-supremacy-trap)
- Kevin Alexander, [Why Authentic Food is Bullshit](https://www.thrillist.com/eat/nation/why-authentic-food-is-bullshit)


{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Reading response' text="
If you agree with the general sentiment of the readings that authenticity is pretty flimsy construct, why is it so engrained in our food culture? How do you think it arose? Why do many/most people care still about it? What does it say about those who value it?
"%}



## Jun 4

### Cuisines of Contact
- _HAE_, 1-31 (1: Cuisine of Contact).
- Heather Trigg, “Food Choice and Social Identity in Early Colonial New Mexico”, 223–252.

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Reading response' text="
How do the readings describe how food and personal/community/national identity are related?"
%}



## Jun 5
{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Learning Reflection 1 due today' text="
Learning Reflection 1 is due today. See the [learning reflection guide](learning-reflections) and the first 10 minutes of the [weekly reflection tips video](https://youtu.be/l2izXCxn2xo). (the remainder of the video is a preview of week 2.)
"%}

{% include alert.html class='warning' title='New Book starts Monday' text="
We start reading  _Tastes like Chicken_ on Monday, though you are encouraged to read ahead this weekend. Even before you start reading, please consult the [book reflection guide](book-reflections).
"%}



# Week 2

## Jun 08

### _Tastes like Chicken_, 1--39

### Revolutionary Food
- _HAE_, 33-55 (2: Food and the Founding).
- James E. McWilliams, “‘How Unripe We Are’”, _Food, Culture & Society_ 8.2 (2005): 143–60.

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Reading response' text="
Think about and address the questions on the [reading response guide](reading-responses). Note that unlike last week, from now on there will not usually be a separate syllabus or discussion board prompt for you to follow (too confusing!). Instead, you'll just address the questions listed in the Response Guide. This should make it easier for you to talk about what interests you. Also note that the expected length of the reading responses has been reduced by 50 words (now 200-250 words) so we're all not totally burnt out by the end of the week.
"%}


## Jun 09

### _Tastes like Chicken_, 40--83

### Early Cookbooks
The below readings will help you do the [Cookbook Analysis](cookbook-analysis) assignment that's due today. So read them with USING them in mind, not for writing a response about them.
- Keith Stavely and Kathleen Fitzgerald, _America\'s Founding Food_ (4: Cookbooks and Commerce), 120--147. This is very helpful in understanding the world of food production at the time early cookbooks we're looking at were written, and part of the reason for their emergence. Skim to page 129 and read more carefully after that.
- Harry Haff, _The Founders of American Cuisine: Seven Cookbook Authors, with Historical Recipes_ (2: Amelia Simmons), 21--33. Note in particular how the author analyzes Simmons's cookbook. This is what you'll be doing for your assignment today.


{% include alert.html class='info' title='Assignment Demo: Analyzing historic cookbooks' text='
The following resources form the basis of the assignment demo, so I want to list them here, but you don\'t need to read through these on your own.

The assignment demo video is posted on the YouTube Channel, and you can [watch it here](https://youtu.be/XU8JkkuzpP8).

#### Cookbooks as historical sources
- Keith Stavely and Kathleen Fitzgerald, _United Tastes: The Making of the First American Cookbook_ (2: Culinary Tradition), 29-51. This provides a fascinating cultural background of cookbooks and their evolution. Honestly the first few sentences of each paragraph will give you enough background.
- Colleen Cotter, "Claiming a Piece of the Pie", 51--68.
- Jane C. Busch, "Using Cookbooks as Research Documents", 22--25.


#### Sample cookbooks
- Amelia Simmons, [American Cookery](https://books.google.com/books?id=_6CggcPs3iQC)

- Mary Randolph [The Virginia Housewife](https://books.google.com/books?id=R4YEAAAAYAAJ)

- [More influential historic cookbooks](http://www.americantable.org/2015/12/top-12-most-influential-historic-american-cookbooks/)

- [First Thanksgiving Menu](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/what-was-on-the-menu-at-the-first-thanksgiving-511554/)


{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Reading response' text="
As usual, think about the questions in the [reading response guide](reading-responses). HOWEVER, there's one additional question to consider and discuss this week: Based on the Deloria reading (your response should make it clear you're well acquainted with it), how much is the national holiday of Thanksgiving more or less a ritual of reaffirming institutionalized marginalization and oppression? (something you may have heard about in the news this past week...)
"%}



## Jun 11

### _Tastes like Chicken_, 121--148

# Week 4

## Jun 22

### Natural Diets
American Food can't be discussed without reference to American dieting. Wherefore our collective insanity about the relationship between food and health. How much do Fad Diets help define American Food? How should we understand the idea of "natural" in terms of American food?

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Mini-lecture: Natural Food in America' text="

Your FINAL Learning Reflection---over the WHOLE CLASS and not just this week---is due today. See the `Final Learning Reflection` section of the [Weekly Learning Reflection Guide](learning-reflections). I can't emphasize enough that this SHOULD NOT BE A SUMMARY of what we've covered. Instead, as the instructions explain in more detail, illustrate how your thinking about food has changed over the month, and how your submitted work justifies what you think should be your overall grade for the course.
