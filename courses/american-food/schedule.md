# IN PROGRESS!
This syllabus is a living document and changes frequently (seriously!), depending on what's going on in the course. If you print it out, you'll need to keep your paper version up to date with the online version. I will always announce important changes in class.

As it stands, below is the general reading schedule. Mondays have a larger reading load (since you have 3 days to do it), and other days have less.

### You don't have to read every word carefully to absorb the key features of our books---namely how they approach the topic, what kind of argument they make, what kinds of sources they use, how interesting it is, etc.

As they are solidified, more precise assignments will be detailed on the appropriate days.


## Jun 4
- Review the syllabus, course aims, assignments, and general plan for the semester. We'll also figure out how to customize the course to best suit participants' interests. We'll begin with a few general readings on definitions of American Food.
