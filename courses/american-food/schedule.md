# IN PROGRESS!
This syllabus is a living document and changes frequently (seriously!), depending on what's going on in the course. If you print it out, you'll need to keep your paper version up to date with the online version. I will always announce important changes in class.

As it stands, below is the general reading schedule. Mondays have a larger reading load (since you have 3 days to do it), and other days have less.

## Key to sanity
You probably think there is a lot of reading. You're right! That's one of the skills we're practicing here---learning to read quickly and effectively. You don't have to read every word carefully to absorb the key features of our books---namely how they approach the topic, what kind of argument they make, what kinds of sources they use, how interesting it is, how they differ from each other, etc. That's what we'll be talking about during our book discussions.

## It's summer
This course is a challenge, but I do recognize that it's summer and it should be possible to learn a lot and have fun doing it. So there aren't any exams, long papers, or any of that sort of thing. There isn't much to do most days except read and come to class.

## Note about _The Cooking Gene_
This book is (obviously) long, but a relatively easy (yet provocative) read. Given the length, it doesn't make sense to try to read the whole thing in a week, as with the other smaller books, so we'll consume it evenly throughout the course and discuss it at the end and how it complicates the narrative provided by the other books. You should read about 5 chapters (~100 pages) per week.

### As they are solidified, more precise class activities (and any preparatory work) will be detailed on the appropriate days.
