- For the following (all mentioned on the Early American Cookbooks page), there are no specific pages to read. But skim through the books and read a recipe here and there so you have a sense of their similarities and differences. What strikes you as most surprising or bizarre about the cookbooks?

- The main objective: Describe what your cookbook tells us about American Culture/Food/Cuisine
- Apply the readings and our discussion to your analysis of the cookbooks
  - What kind of assumptions does the author(s) make about cooking/cuisine/food?
  - Who is the intended audience? What should they know? What should they care about?
  - What does the intended audience want?
  - What kind of language (commands, narrative, etc) does the cookbook use?
  - What kind of larger themes do the cookbooks appeal to (exotic, health, comfort, regional, national, hipster, classic, etc)
  - What are the various "national" or "ethnic" influences?
  - What do the cookbooks say about "American Food"?
  - Why does this book exist?
  - You are being evaluated on the quality/depth of your ANALYSIS (based on class readings and discussion), NOT DESCRIPTION.

## Jun 21
???

### Website Analysis Guide (800-1000 words)
- We will walk through how to conduct final website analysis summary (now due last day of class)

- Google "history of X" where X is some food related topic.
- Write 800-1000 words that analyze the search results through the lenses we used throughout the course.
  - Put your search phrase at the top of your assignment
- DO NOT SIMPLY DESCRIBE THE VARIOUS WEBSITES!
- The assignment is to describe the aggregate results; you are trying to create a typology.
  - A TYPOLOGY is an explanation of the KINDS of approaches, including their strengths and weaknesses.
- As you did with cookbooks: You should indicate WHY the sites say what they do (don't worry about design).
- What can they tell us about approaches/values/interests related to food in America?

- Maybe the best way to think of what you're doing: Imagine that you're creating a writing guide for the first page of search results. You're writing for someone interested in the topic, but hasn't taken this class and therefore might not be aware of the many assumptions/biases/omissions/etc that can easily infiltrate and entire set of sources. Your job, therefore, is to help guide your curious but naive reader through the minefield of food history on the web.

- FOR BOTH: You now have, however rushed, expertise in the history of American Food. Use that expertise to write a critical and informed review. You are being evaluated on the extent to which your expertise shines through your reviews.

### Fad Diets (watch/read IN ORDER)
American Food can't be discussed without reference to American dieting. As with previous readings, we're not reading these because they are "right", but because they illustrate a collective insanity about the relationship between food and health. How much do Fad Diets help define American Food? How should we understand the idea of "natural" in terms of American food.
