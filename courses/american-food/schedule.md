# Schedule of Readings & Assignments


### Due dates
All posted assignments are technically "due" on the day they are listed so that we all stay on schedule. An occasional late post is fine. Repeatedly late posts will negatively impact your grade, as your score decreases by one point per day. After a week, you get a zero. The course simply moves too quickly for much flexibility with deadlines.

### Video lectures
All video lectures will be posted on the [course YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeiHxkIHW5kM1hqofknf2ig), and I will link to them on the syllabus as they become available. If you want announcements of new videos, please subscribe to the channel.

### Read/watch in order
I list the readings/videos in the order I think it will be most useful to you. Usually, the earlier readings (or videos) introduce some ideas that get elaborated on in later readings. Going out of order can make things much more confusing, but of course you're free to work through the readings however you wish.

### Noteworthy is optional
Most days have a "noteworthy" section that lists a few relevant readings on the topic. These are optional! Most have some good ideas that I'll mention in the videos; others are there just for additional materials and extra credit opportunities. I hope you'll skim through any that seem interesting to you (and I hope you'll mention them in your posts so you can get credit for that work).

### All non-linked reading assignments are in Zotero
Remember that if there isn't a direct link to a reading, it's in our course Zotero library. Instructions are on the [syllabus home page](index) under `Readings and Books`.


# Week 1

## Jun 7

### Course introductions
Our task for today is to make sure you know how the course is structured and general expectations.

- [VIDEO: Course Intro, Syllabus Intro, and Why I like food](https://youtu.be/w4WJ5wmduY8)
- Warren Belasco, "Why study food?", from _Food: The Key Concepts_, 1--13. Note the last couple pages are about eating meat (and seems a bit shaded against it, IMO). But Belasco misses a couple major points when talking about both the benefits and consequences of eating meat. On the quiz for today, plan to articulate what you think he is **not** addressing---but should---in that section. Hint: Does it have anything to do with his definition of "meat"?


{% include alert.html class='warning' title='Syllabus quiz' text="
This will cover the course into video, the syllabus, and the short Belasco reading.
"%}

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Introductory post' text="
Just to make sure everyone is connected, and as an informal way of introducing ourselves, please post on the class Discussion Board in UNM Learn (should be an obvious link on the left nav bar in Learn) a brief introduction and one of your most vivid food memories---and why it resonates with you. These should be ~150 words or so. Please REPLY to the previous post (I've already put one there as a starter) so that we get one continuous thread---that makes reading through them MUCH easier.

Remember that all work, including these introductions, are due on the the day they are listed on the syllabus---that's today!

## Jun 8

### Challenges and Rewards of Food + History
I think this whole course makes more sense when you understand how and why people study food the way they do. So that's what the lecture is about, complemented by the Haley reading that argues we should resist the urge to romanticize the culinary past as is so often done in food media. A) It's never that simple and B) the real history is far more interesting and revealing.

- Andrew P. Haley, "The Nation before Taste: The Challenges of American Culinary History", _The Public Historian_ 34.2 (2012): 53--78.
- VIDEO: How and why to do food history

#### Noteworthy
- G. J. Fitzgerald and G. M. Petrick, "In Good Taste: Rethinking American History with Our Palates", _Journal of American History_ 95.2 (2008): 392--404.

{% include alert.html class='warning' title='Lecture and Reading Quiz' text="
This will cover the lecture and the Haley reading.

## Jun 9

### National Cuisine & American Food
The goal for today is to complicate the idea of "American" food through an investigation of national cuisine generally and ways of thinking about it. There are an unusually high number of readings for today, but they are all quite short!  

- _HAE_, xi--xv.
- _Mind of Chef_: [Ed Lee on American Food](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5DZui1nrAs)
- Alison K. Smith, [National Cuisines](https://www-oxfordhandbooks-com.libproxy.unm.edu/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199729937.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199729937-e-25), from _The Oxford Handbook of Food History_ (2012). You can read more quickly over the long Russia example if you want, as the details don't much as the general ideas introduced earlier on. But do read the last paragraph! This is definitely the driest of the readings for this week, but it introduces a number of useful concepts to keep in mind as moving through the other readings.
- Sean Wyer, [Italy isn't Eatalty](https://vittles.substack.com/p/italy-isnt-eataly). The title and conclusion of this article relate the unsurprising point that the cuisine of an entire nation can't be captured in a giant upscale grocery store. We hardly need to article to explain that to us, but the author makes a number of good points about how to think about national cuisine.
- Ruth Tobias, [Is There Such a Thing as ‘American’ Food?](https://www.tastingtable.com/culture/national/defining-american-food-cuisine). This article touches on culinary/cultural appropriation, which is a topic we cover in some depth in a few weeks, so focus for no
- Sidney Mintz, "Eating American". This is easily the most controversial piece this week, suggesting there is no such thing as American Cuisine. Pay attention to his arguments so you can craft a thoughtful reading reflection for this week.

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Reading reflection' text="
1. make sure you're familiar with the [reading reflection guide](reading-reflections).
2. DRAWING FROM THE SET OF READINGS: What are the most useful ideas for thinking about national cuisine that you noted? Can a cuisine be defined by its diversity as Tobias suggests? Or does such diversity mean there really isn't an American cuisine (as Mintz suggests)? Does the essence of a cuisine lie in certain \"dispositions\" as Tobias suggests?
3. Don't forget your 1-2 THOUGHTFUL questions at the end that I can address in the next video. See the [reading reflection guide](reading-reflections) for more.

## Jun 10

### Authenticity
Almost everyone thinks about whether some kind of food or dish is authentic from time to time. But what does that really mean? The few readings for today should help us think more carefully about why we do that and how useful it is. And most importantly, how we can do it more effectively.

- Dwight Furrow, _American Foodie_ (7: Habits and Heresies: Authenticity, Food Rules, and Traditions), 133--48.
- Kevin Alexander, [Why Authentic Food is Bullshit](https://www.thrillist.com/eat/nation/why-authentic-food-is-bullshit)

#### Noteworthy
- Sara Kay, [Yelp Reviewers’ Authenticity Fetish Is White Supremacy in Action](https://ny.eater.com/2019/1/18/18183973/authenticity-yelp-reviews-white-supremacy-trap).
- Rachel Laudan, [Desperately Seeking Authenticity](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2001-dec-19-fo-16368-story.html)
- Matthew Strohl, ‘On Culinary Authenticity’, _The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism_, 77.2 (2019), 157--67.


{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Reading reflection' text="
These readings give us some new perspectives on the idea of authenticity and cast some (if not significant) doubt on the value of the concept. How is it useful? How is it not? Why do many (if not most people) care still about it? What does it say about those who value it? MAIN QUESTION: Alexander's article is provocative and fun and sometimes smart. But would it be even smarter if it incorporate more of Furrow's ideas?
"%}



## Jun 11 (Fri)
### Cuisines of Contact & Thanksgiving
- _HAE_, 1--11 (from 1: Cuisine of Contact).
- Janet Siskind, “The Invention of Thanksgiving: A Ritual of American Nationality", 167--91.

#### Noteworthy
- Philip Deloria, “The Invention of Thanksgiving”, _New Yorker_, 95.37 (November 25, 2019): 70--74.
- [First Thanksgiving Menu](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/what-was-on-the-menu-at-the-first-thanksgiving-511554/)

{% include alert.html class='warning' title='Readings Quiz' text="
This quiz covers basics from the readings, but also has short answer questions about the various myths and meanings associated with Thanksgiving. How much does Thanksgiving reflect both nationalism (of some people) and marginalization (of other people)?
"%}




# Week 2

## Jun 14
###  On Cuisines and Corn
- _HAE_, 13--31 (from 1: Cuisine of Contact).
- Keith Stavely and Kathleen Fitzgerald, _America's Founding Food_ (1: This Beautifull Noble Eare), 4--48. Read 4--22; and 45--48 more carefully; skim 22--45 on the various dishes.

#### Noteworthy
- John Lawerence, [Cheap Corn Permeates Every Facet of the American Diet](https://sandiegofreepress.org/2014/04/cheap-corn-permeates-every-facet-of-the-american-diet-2/#.YJ7o-GZKixs)
- Erick Castellanos and Sarah Bergstresser, "The Mexican and Transnational Lives of Corn: Technological, Political, Edible Object", in _Edible Identities_ (ed. Broulotte and Di Giovine), Taylor & Francis (2016), 201--216.

{% include alert.html class='warning' title='Reading Quiz' text="
This quiz covers early food consumption in early America, how food and personal/community/national identity were intertwined (as we see in attitudes about corn) and how meanings of food can be utterly transformed over time.
"%}



## Jun 15
### Early America, Early Food
- _HAE_, 33--55 (2: Food and the Founding).
- Keith Stavely and Kathleen Fitzgerald, _America's Founding Food_ (4: Cookbooks and Commerce), 120--147. Even though not clearly marked, there are really two distinct parts to this readings. The first part (to p.129) is very helpful in understanding capitalist logic of food production in the late 1700s and early 1800s. The second part shows how early cookbooks start reflect the cultural changes underway during that time.

#### Noteworthy
- James E. McWilliams, “‘How Unripe We Are’”, _Food, Culture & Society_ 8.2 (2005): 143--60.

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Reading Reflection' text="
What was the role of food in Revolutionary America? How were ideas of FREEDOM were intimately tied to food and therefore American identity?

## Jun 16
### Cookbooks as historical sources
The below readings will help you do the upcoming [Cookbook Analysis](cookbook-analysis) assignment. So read them with USING them in mind, not for writing a response about them. But there is a quiz to highlight a few key points.
- Barbara Ketcham Wheaton, "Cookbook as Resources for Social History". This chapter very nicely sketches out, with many diverse examples, how cookbooks function as windows onto history, including how and why they were used in the world.
- Ken Albala, [Cookbooks as Historical Documents](https://www-oxfordhandbooks-com.libproxy.unm.edu/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199729937.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199729937-e-13). This chapter, although a bit long, very nicely lays out a process for interrogating cookbooks and reading in between the lines. The questions and methods described in the article are exactly what you be doing with your own [cookbook analysis](cookbook-analysis) due tomorrow.


#### Noteworthy
- Rachel A. Snell, [As North American as Pumpkin Pie: Cookbooks and the Development of National Cuisine in North America, 1796-1854](https://www.erudit.org/fr/revues/cuizine/2014-v5-n2-cuizine01533/1026771ar/).
- Keith Stavely and Kathleen Fitzgerald, _United Tastes: The Making of the First American Cookbook_ (2: Culinary Tradition), 29--51. This provides a fascinating cultural background of cookbooks and their evolution. Honestly the first few sentences of each paragraph will give you enough background.
- Harry Haff, _The Founders of American Cuisine: Seven Cookbook Authors, with Historical Recipes_ (2: Amelia Simmons), 21--33. Note in particular how the author analyzes Simmons's cookbook. This is what you'll be doing for your assignment.
- Colleen Cotter, "Claiming a Piece of the Pie", 51--68.
- Jane C. Busch, "Using Cookbooks as Research Documents", 22--25.

#### Some cookbooks mentioned in the readings

#### Noteworthy
- Michael Twitty, _The Cooking Gene_, 1--24.
- [Michael Twitty on Culinary Justice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhxjC3XX54g)


{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Reading reflection' text="
Personally, I find most culinary appropriation conversations to be unhelpfully superficial. It is pointless to debate whether culinary/cultural appropriation actually happens (it does), or whether it's just some people being overly sensitive (it is), or whether it can be an (inadvertent) tool of marginalization (it can). These are non-debateable facts. But what is really happening? And what does it really matter?

Use the articles for this week to evaluate a claim we read a few weeks ago from Ruth Tobias ([here](https://www.tastingtable.com/culture/national/defining-american-food-cuisine)): \"The difference between adaptation and appropriation is one of privilege--the privilege to control and inevitably whitewash the narrative surrounding a given dish.\" How is this statement correct? How is it lacking? BE SURE YOU USE THE READINGS TO SUPPORT YOUR ANSWER!
