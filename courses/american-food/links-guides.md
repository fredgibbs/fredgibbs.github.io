# Links and Guides
This page contains a list of links that you will probably need repeatedly throughout the term. Some of these links are to assignment guides that provide explicit directions on how to set up tools and complete required assignments. Some documents don't exist yet but will appear here when they do, and always well in advance of when you need them. Early set-up guides for Zotero and GitHub are not here--only on the schedule page, since you shouldn't need them more than once.

## Submitting work and quizzes
- [UNM Learn](http://learn.unm.edu). All assignments will be submitted via UNM Learn.

## Readings
- We use [Zotero](http://zotero.org) to manage course readings. See the [getting started guide](http://fredgibbs.net/courses/etc/zotero); once connected you can access the [course library](https://www.zotero.org/groups/2499167/american-food-unm/library). Note that anyone can VIEW the course library, but you can only access the PDF scans if you're logged in and have joined the group library.

## Mini-lectures
- The course [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeiHxkIHW5kM1hqofknf2ig) will host mini-lectures and other screencasts.

## General communication
- [Slack channel](http://american-food.slack.com); first click the [invitation link](https://join.slack.com/t/american-food/shared_invite/zt-ef9zksoz-W2SiBrv9LfMvg~b00xNAhw). Use this for quick questions rather than email! Slack is a great collaborative messaging app that allows us to stay connected without more formal emails or messages in UNM Learn. I get notifications about messages so I can get back to you quickly. For personal or private issues, email is best.
