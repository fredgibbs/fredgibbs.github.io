# Cookbook Analysis Guide
Pick a book from [this collection](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/mb?c=1934413200;a=listis;sort=date_a;sz=100), and make sure it's from the 1800s or early 1900s--anything before 1910 is fine. It is well worth your time to find a book that piques your interest. Spending 5-10 minutes finding a book that you actually find interesting make the assignment MUCH easier and more effective as a learning exercise. Click the "Full View" link to actually see the cookbook; if it doesn't work for some reason, it's probably best to just choose another one.


## Basic Goals
- ~800--900 words. But quality is more important than quantity.
- Give a brief summary of the author's tone/style, organization, topics covered, and other main features of the book.
- Apply the readings and our discussions to your analysis of a historic cookbook based on the questions below. We've talked a lot of about attitudes toward ingredients and dishes, as well as how food reveals and affirms identity. How does (or not) your cookbook illustrate the issues we've been discussing?
- Enjoy looking through a primary source for food history! This is meant to be more of a fun way of engaging with historical sources and getting a feel for a very common source of food history.



## Questions to write about
I've asked you to write a brief description of the book on the whole (see "basic goals, above"), but that's the boring part. The fun part is READING BETWEEN THE LINES to learn about the author and American culture and cuisine from the cookbook.

- Who is the intended audience? What do they know?
- What kind of assumptions does the author(s) make about cooking/cuisine/food?
- What kind of larger themes do the cookbooks appeal to (exotic, health, comfort, frugality, regional or national food, etc)?
- What are the various "national" or "ethnic" influences of the recipes or instructions?
- How much does tradition or originality matter to the author?
- What does it contribute to an understanding of "American Food"?
- What struck you as most interesting or unexpected about the cookbook?

As with reading reflection prompts, you might find it more interesting/useful to spend more time on some questions over others depending on the kind of cookbook you have. So don't feel like you need to address each one explicitly, but you should try to address them as a set of questions as best you can.


## References and Citations
Any time you refer to a specific quote or idea from a specific should a have parenthetical page reference so that a reader can look it up to better understand the context. These also show the reader (and graders, in our case) HOW you are using the book in your analysis. For example: The author claims that all meat should be cooked until well done (13).


## Questions
Writing is hard enough, and virtually impossible when you're not sure what you're trying to do. Please get in touch with questions!
