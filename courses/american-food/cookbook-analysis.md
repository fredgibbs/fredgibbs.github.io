# Cookbook Analysis Guide
- Pick a book from [here](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/mb?c=1934413200;a=listis;sort=date_a;sz=100), but make sure it's not one we've already discussed.


## Main objectives
- Describe what your cookbook tells us about American Culture/Food/Cuisine
- Apply the readings and our discussion to your analysis of the cookbooks

## Questions to ask your cookbook
  - What kind of assumptions does the author(s) make about cooking/cuisine/food?
  - Is there a moral or political nutritional agenda baked into it?
  - Who is the intended audience? What should they know? What should they care about?
  - What kind of language (commands, narrative, etc) does the cookbook use?
  - What kind of larger themes do the cookbooks appeal to (exotic, health, comfort, regional, national, hipster, classic, etc)?
  - What are the various "national" or "ethnic" influences?
  - Do you get a sense of where the recipes came from? (aside: does this class help?)
  - What kinds of ingredients and recipes appear? What does NOT appear that you might have expected?
  - How much does history or tradition matter to the recipes?
  - What do the cookbooks say about "American Food"?

## Pro Tip
  - You are being evaluated on the quality/depth of your ANALYSIS (based on class readings and discussion), NOT DESCRIPTION.
