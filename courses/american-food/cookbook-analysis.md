# Cookbook Analysis Guide
Pick a book from [here](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/mb?c=1934413200;a=listis;sort=date_a;sz=100), but make sure it's not one we've already discussed. It is well worth your time to find a book that piques your interest somehow. Spending 5-10 minutes finding a book that you actually find interesting make the assignment MUCH easier and more effective as a learning exercise.


## Basic Goals
- ~800 words
- Describe BRIEFLY what kinds of topics your book covers
- Apply the readings and our discussions to your analysis of a historic cookbook
- Describe what your cookbook tells us about American Culture/Food/Cuisine
- Have some fun looking through a primary source for food history! This is meant to be more of a fun assignment than a laborious analysis.


## Questions to ask your cookbook and write about:
- What kind of assumptions does the author(s) make about cooking/cuisine/food?
- Who is the intended audience? What should they know? What should they care about?
- What kind of larger themes do the cookbooks appeal to (exotic, health, comfort, regional, national, classical, etc)?
- What are the various "national" or "ethnic" influences? Do you get a sense of where the recipes came from?
- What kinds of ingredients and recipes appear? What does NOT appear that you might have expected?
- How much does history or tradition matter to the author or recipes?
- What does it contribute to an understanding of "American Food" at the time it was published?
- What is your overall impression of the cookbook? What is most interesting? Unexpected?



## References and Citations
Anything in your text that refers to a specific quote or idea should a have parenthetical page reference. These show the reader how you are using the book in your analysis.

For example: The author claims that food is no longer good for us (13). The author of the book is implied since we only have one source. If you are citing other texts from class, use author/date format (Gibbs, 75).


## Questions
Writing is hard enough, and virtually impossible when you're not sure what you're trying to do. Please get in touch!
