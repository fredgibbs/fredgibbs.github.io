# Cookbook Analysis Guide
- Take a modern cookbook published recently or find a historic cookbook from [here](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/mb?c=1934413200;a=listis)
- The main objective: Describe what your cookbook tells us about American Culture/Food/Cuisine
- Apply the readings and our discussion to your analysis of the cookbooks
  - What kind of assumptions does the author(s) make about cooking/cuisine/food?
  - Who is the intended audience? What should they know? What should they care about?
  - What does the intended audience want?
  - What kind of language (commands, narrative, etc) does the cookbook use?
  - What kind of larger themes do the cookbooks appeal to (exotic, health, comfort, regional, national, hipster, classic, etc)
  - What are the various "national" or "ethnic" influences?
  - What do the cookbooks say about "American Food"?
  - Why does this book exist?
  - You are being evaluated on the quality/depth of your ANALYSIS (based on class readings and discussion), NOT DESCRIPTION.
