# Film Analysis Essay

## Objective
This assignment encourages you to bring what we've learned in class in critiquing and analyzing a documentary or film focused on food.

## Basics
- 800-1000 words
- 1.5 - 2 line spacing
- 11pt Times New Roman
- Free of typos and basic grammatical errors
- Smooth, focused writing

## Questions to address
Here are some questions to address in your essay. They are basically the same as the food writing presentation questions.

- BRIEFLY summarize the plot of the film
- Summarize what you think the moral or take home message is, including whatever the film says is the purpose, but also including other important points that you think it makes.
- What kind of assumptions does it make about cooking/cuisine/food?
- Who is the intended audience? What should they know? What should they care about?
- What kind of rhetorical effects does the author use?
- What kind of larger themes does the film appeal to (sustainability, responsibility, health, comfort, regional, national, hipster, classic, etc)?
- How are the ideas of "national" or "ethnic" or "authentic" cuisine addressed?
- What constitutes "good" food in the film?

## Analyze! Don't summarize
- You are being evaluated on the quality/depth of your ANALYSIS! While a brief description and summary of the film is necessary, it should serve as an introduction to your analysis, which will comprise almost all of your essay.

## MOST IMPORTANT QUESTIONS TO ADDRESS
- How does this film reflect contemporary American Food Culture? How does it NOT?
