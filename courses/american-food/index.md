## Course Description
When you think of Mexican food, or Italian, or Chinese, a range of dishes and ingredients immediately spring to mind. But what about American food? Is there such a thing? How much does the history of American Food tell a very different story of US History than we typically hear? How are ideas of nationalism reflected in our foodways? What constitutes a "national" cuisine? Does this concept even make sense anymore?

The goal of this course is to see how much fun we can have exploring different perspectives on the concept of national cuisine and American food. Never shall we care about memorizing and regurgitating supposedly important historical "facts".

Each class meeting is 2.5 hours, which is long. So we'll break it up into various activities (with breaks), including mini-lectures, small and large group discussion of common readings (the books), and primary source analyses (mixes of newspapers, ads, menus, literature, trade journals), as well as student presentations on select short readings (of your choice) that dive deeper into topics touched on in the books.

Some questions we'll tackle: What have Americans eaten over time? Why? How much have immigration and regionalization mattered? How have food production, technology, and marketing practices changed eating habits? How have dietary and nutritional advice altered perceptions of food and cuisine over the 20th century? How have recent global industrial conglomerates shaped the idea of what constitutes American food? What can the future of American food learn from its past?


## Student Learning Outcomes
- Think and write critically about how various people at various times have discussed the concept of American food
- Identify and appreciate the various drivers of change with respect to food production and consumption in America
- Discuss and write critically about how attitudes toward food are influenced by shifting cultural, social, religious, scientific, and political values
- Understand how different historians construct very different histories of American food and its significance


## Work Requirements and Grading

### It's summer
As an upper level history course compressed into a month, it's meant to be a challenge. But I do recognize that it's summer, and that we're still recovering from last semester/year. There isn't much to do most days except do the preparatory reading, reflect on it, come to class, and participate in the conversations and activities. For the major assignments (see below), we'll practice doing them together before you do them on your own.

**Given the compressed nature of the class, the main work/fun on which you will be evaluated is general engagement in our daily activities and conversation.**

- Thorough preparedness and engaged participation in class meetings (30 points)
- Small reading response assignments (30 points)
- Reading/discussion quizzes  (10 points)
- Food writing presentations (10 points)
- Cookbook analysis (10 points) [instructions](cookbook-analysis)
- Digital Food History analysis (10 points) [instructions](website-analysis)

### Please Ask for Help
I heartily encouraged you to speak with me at any time about how I think you're doing in the class and how it can be improved (if at all). If life gets overwhelming during the course, it can be tempting to drift away from an elective course like this. PLEASE DON'T! Rather than disappear, please come talk with me about how we can accommodate your circumstances.


## Learn to Read Quickly
If you peek at the reading schedule page, you might think there is a lot of reading. You're right! That's one of the key skills we're developing in this course---learning to read quickly and effectively. You don't have to read every word carefully to absorb the key features of the assignment. You simply need to read enough to form an opinion on how they approach the topic, what kind of argument they make, what kinds of sources they use, how interesting it is, how they differ from each other, etc. That's what we'll be talking about during our discussions, and you'll learn from everyone else's interpretations.

Almost all readings are meant for a broad (largely non-academic) audience and therefore are relatively quick and engaging reads. At the same time, they are smart, articulate, and give us plenty to talk about, especially as we put them in conversation with each other, and how they tell very different stories of American Food
