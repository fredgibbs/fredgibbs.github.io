# History of American Food

## Logistics
- HIST 413
- Summer 2021
- 3 Credit Hours
- Web remote (asynchronous; no set meeting time)
- Fred Gibbs \([fwgibbs@unm.edu](mailto:fwgibbs@unm.edu)\)

## Getting Started
This page, and the [schedule page](schedule), have all the instructions and assignments you need for the course. Make sure you are very familiar with these two pages. We use UNM Learn to manage quizzes, assignment submissions, and the discussion board, but all course information is on these two pages.



## Course Description
When you think of Mexican food, or Italian, or Chinese, a range of dishes and ingredients immediately spring to mind. Why is that? What constitutes a "national" cuisine? Does this concept even make sense anymore? What about American food? Is there (or was there ever) such a thing? How much does the history of American Food present a different kind of American History from we typically hear? How are ideas of nationalism reflected in our foodways?

The goal of this course is to see how much fun we can have exploring different perspectives on the concept of national cuisine and American food. There will be some history, but that's beside the point. Never shall we care about memorizing and regurgitating supposedly important historical "facts".

Some questions we'll tackle: What have Americans eaten over time? Why? How do we construct identities through food? How much have immigration and regionalization shaped dietary preferences? How have dietary and nutritional advice altered perceptions of food and cuisine over the 20th century? How have relatively recent global industrial conglomerates shaped the idea of what constitutes American food? What can the future of American food learn from its past?


## Student Learning Objectives
- Understand how attitudes toward food are influenced by shifting cultural, social, religious, scientific, and political values
- Think critically about how various people at various times have discussed what to eat and why
- Understand how different historians construct very different histories of American food and its significance


## Tech tools
- [UNM Learn](http://learn.unm.edu). All assignments will be submitted via UNM Learn.
- [Zotero](http://zotero.org); see the [getting started guide](http://fredgibbs.net/courses/etc/zotero); once connected you can access the [course library](https://www.zotero.org/groups/2499167/american-food-unm/library).
- [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeiHxkIHW5kM1hqofknf2ig) will host lectures and other screencasts. I put links to everything on the syllabus once they are uploaded, but I don't barge into your inbox just to tell you there's a new video. If you want such notifications, you can subscribe to the Channel and get them automatically.


## Work Requirements

### It's summer
As an upper level history course compressed into a month, this class is meant to be a challenge. But I do recognize that it's summer, that we're still recovering from this past year and that we all have busy lives outside of class even when not amidst a pandemic. AND YET: We can work hard and learn a lot together without taking ourselves too seriously.

### It's a marathon, not a sprint
Not having actual class meetings (as the course normally does) deprives us of some collegial conversation, but it presents new freedoms as well. There isn't much to do most days except do the reading, reflect on it, and take a short quiz or write a brief response. There are a few slightly longer assignments that give you the chance to apply the readings more directly and a course final to show off what you've learned.


### Required
The little equations after the assignment type indicates `number of assignments` x `points for each` = `total points`
- [Reading/lecture reflections](reading-responses) (7x15 = 100) [actually 105, but rounding down gives you free points]
- Reading/lecture quizzes (10x10 = 100)
- [Early cookbook analysis](cookbook-analysis) (1x30 = 30)
- [Food blog analysis](food-blog-analysis) (1x30 = 30)
- [Final learning reflection](learning-reflections) (1x40 = 60)

So you can expect around 320 points, but quizzes are sometimes a bit more or less than 10 points and I may swap out one kind of assignment for another, which may slightly change the point total. Your "grade" is determined by percent, as indicated below. To keep up with grading for a large class that has a lot of assignments in a short time, all grading is done through assignment rubrics so that you get a better sense of what I'm looking for and how I think you're doing without me having to write out virtually identical comments over and over again.

The quizzes are mostly straightforward, but not trivial. The goal is to make you THINK CAREFULLY and CRITICALLY about course material. Sometimes I ask deliberately vague questions that don't really have a right answer because I am using the questions to highlight an important ambiguity.  These questions won't count toward your grade, but you won't know which questions count or not. Because this class is about interpretation and argument, you are encouraged to debate on the discussion board ANY quiz question marked as incorrect. If you contribute something original to the discussion (not just, "I agree with the last response!"), you can get extra credit.

The [schedule page](schedule) indicates all due dates for course work; all assignments should be posted to UNM Learn by the end of the day they are listed (by midnight).


### Grading Scale
Whatever the final number of points is, your grade is determined by percent so you can always see in Learn how you are doing regardless of the ultimate possible point total.

Percent | Grade
--- | ---
94+ | A
90-93 | A-
87-89 | B+
83-86 | B
80-82 | B-
77-79 | C+
73-76 | C
70-72 | C-
66-69 | D+
60-65 | D
59- | F


### Submitting Work
All work must be posted to the Discussion Board on UNM Learn by midnight on the day it appears on the syllabus. I don't care if you post at 12:05 or even 1am, so don't stress about that. Everyone is welcome to more time on assignments BUT YOU HAVE TO SEND ME AN EMAIL TO LET ME KNOW. Otherwise your work will be considered late and will be docked 1 point per day. I don't like being draconian about deadlines but the class moves so fast that falling behind even a little quickly spirals out of control. If you need to pause the class for a few days because of some emergency, we can work it out. Please get in touch!


### Work towards your wants and ask for more feedback
Some of you just want a C to fulfill a UNM requirement. Some of you want a B to maintain a solid GPA. Some of you want an A because top grades are really important to you. You all already know what your own average, good, or excellent effort feels like. So put in the work that justifies the grade you want for each assignment. If you're not getting the scores you want, LET ME KNOW. I'm not going to just start giving you higher scores, but there might be some minor tweaks that could go a long way. I want to do everything I can to ensure that the work you're putting in matches the grade you're getting.


### Extra Credit (all due on the Monday after the last day of class)
- [Food Documentary Critique](film-analysis) (6 points)
- Extra credit is only available if all other work is turned in on time, and should be emailed to me directly.

### Please Don't Drift Away
If life gets overwhelming during the course (and _something_ will come up over the month), it's easy to drift away from an intensive elective course like this, especially an online course. PLEASE DON'T! Rather than disappear, let's talk about how we can accommodate your circumstances, including figuring out a target grade, reduced assignments, switching to CR/NC grade mode, etc.


## Course Readings and Books
Most of the reading for the course are book chapters, short articles, blog posts, and the like. These are accessible through a platform called Zotero. All relevant directions are [posted here](http://fredgibbs.net/courses/etc/zotero). Once you've completed those steps, you can access our course readings [here](https://www.zotero.org/groups/2499167/american-food-unm/library).

In addition, a crucial aspect of this course is learning how to read critically about food across a variety of forms, including books. _How America Eats_ is our month-long guide that we read bit by bit (and slightly out of order for reasons that will become clear) throughout the course.

- Wallach, Jennifer Jensen  _How America Eats: A Social History of U.S. Food and Culture_ (Rowman & Littlefield Publishers, 2014). [online](https://unm-worldcat-org.libproxy.unm.edu/title/how-america-eats-a-social-history-of-us-food-and-culture/oclc/794361344&referer=brief_results)


### Familiarity over mastery
If you peek at the reading schedule page, you might think there is a lot of reading. You're right! As an intensive 1H course, there IS a lot of reading. This is unavoidable because I respect the challenges and demands of a compressed four-week course that ostensibly provides comparable intellectual rigor as a full-semester course. So the workload is comparable to any average 1H upper-level humanities course, whether in person or online, but obviously more intense than a regular full semester course.

I've tried to embrace a _less is more_ philosophy, but there's a lot to do, you cannot possibly read every word, or every page, or master all the ideas, **and that's just fine**. I DO expect you to gain a familiarity across all the readings so that you can write a thoughtful response about them. Because we're covering so much ground so quickly, broad familiarity is far more important than specific details.


### Rethinking literacy
True literacy is not just understanding words and sentences. It's being able to read relatively quickly, think critically about what you read, and take away something useful from it (or decide you don't need to).

Almost all readings are meant for a broad (largely non-academic) audience and therefore are relatively quick and engaging reads. At the same time, they are smart, articulate, and give us plenty to talk about, especially as we put them in conversation with each other, and how they tell very different stories of American Food.

You don't have to read every word carefully to take away some useful ideas from the readings. You simply need to read enough and carefully enough to form an opinion on how the authors approach their topics, what kind of argument they make, what kinds of sources they use, how they differ from each other, why you do or don't like it, etc. This is what you'll be writing about in your reading responses.
