## Course Description
When you think of Mexican food, or Italian, or Chinese, a range of dishes and ingredients immediately spring to mind. But what about American food? Is there such a thing? How much does the history of American Food tell a very different story of US History than we typically hear? How are ideas of nationalism reflected in our foodways? What constitutes a "national" cuisine? Does this concept even make sense anymore?

The goal of this course is to see how much fun we can have exploring different perspectives on the concept of national cuisine and American food. Never shall we care about memorizing and regurgitating supposedly important historical "facts".

Each class meeting is 2.5 hours, which is long. So we'll break it up into various activities, including mini-lectures, small and large group discussion of common readings (the books), and primary source analysis (a mix of newspapers, ads, menus, novels, etc), as well as student presentations on select short readings (of your choice) that dive deeper into topics touched on in the books.

Some questions we'll tackle: What have Americans eaten over time? Why? How much have immigration and regionalization mattered? How have food production, technology, and marketing practices changed eating habits? How have dietary and nutritional advice altered perceptions of food and cuisine over the 20th century? How have recent global industrial conglomerates shaped the idea of what constitutes American food? What can the future of American food learn from its past?


## Student Learning Outcomes
- Learn about the history of American food
- Appreciate the various drivers of change with respect to eating in America
- Consider the intersection of food, culture, society, and nationalism
- Understand how different historians construct very different histories of American food


## Work Requirements and Grading

### The main work/fun for this class is not in exams or essays or other stuff you might submit for a grade, but rather general engagement in our daily conversation.

- Thorough preparedness and engaged participation in every class meeting  (50%)
- Serious effort and on-time completion of the in-class presentations (30%)
- Pop quizzes and other in-class miscellany (20%)
- I heartily encouraged you to speak with me at any time about how I think you're doing in the class and how it can be improved (if at all)
- If life gets overwhelming during the course, it can be tempting to drift away from an elective course like this. Rather than disappear, please come talk with me about how we can accommodate your circumstances and thus avoid digging a huge hole from which it becomes increasingly difficult to escape.


## Required Readings
There's a wacko amount of reading for this course. That's what you get for condensing a semester-long history course into a month. **DO NOT DESPAIR!** The readings are meant for a broad (largely non-academic) audience and therefore quick and engaging reads. Yet they still give us plenty to talk about, especially as we put them in conversation with each other. I have tried to minimize assignments of dense and difficult academic prose, although it's worth pushing ourselves from time to time. It's summer, after all, and the course is designed with that fact in mind.


All readings that aren't already online (and some that are) will be available through the class Zotero library. This will be discussed in class, but please note the [instructions for connecting](http://fredgibbs.net/courses/etc/zotero.html). The URL for the group library will be posted here eventually.
