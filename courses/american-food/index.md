# History of American Food

## Logistics
- HIST 413
- Summer 2020
- 3 Credit Hours
- Web remote (asynchronous; no set meeting time)
- Fred Gibbs \([fwgibbs@unm.edu](mailto:fwgibbs@unm.edu)\) 

## Getting Started
This page, and the [schedule page](schedule), have all the instructions and assignments you need for the course. Make sure you are very familiar with these two pages. We use UNM Learn to manage quizzes, assignment submissions, and the discussion board, but all course information is on these two pages.

While I hope the syllabus is self-explanatory, you should take a few minutes to watch the [introductory video]().


## Course Description
When you think of Mexican food, or Italian, or Chinese, a range of dishes and ingredients immediately spring to mind. Why is that? What constitutes a "national" cuisine? Does this concept even make sense anymore? What about American food? Is there (or was there ever) such a thing? How much does the history of American Food present a different kind of American History from we typically hear? How are ideas of nationalism reflected in our foodways?

The goal of this course is to see how much fun we can have exploring different perspectives on the concept of national cuisine and American food. There will be some history, but that's beside the point. Never shall we care about memorizing and regurgitating supposedly important historical "facts".

Some questions we'll tackle: What have Americans eaten over time? Why? How do we construct identities through food? How much have immigration and regionalization shaped dietary preferences? How have dietary and nutritional advice altered perceptions of food and cuisine over the 20th century? How have relatively recent global industrial conglomerates shaped the idea of what constitutes American food? What can the future of American food learn from its past?


## Student Learning Objectives
- Understand how attitudes toward food are influenced by shifting cultural, social, religious, scientific, and political values
- Think critically about how various people at various times have discussed what to eat and why
- Understand how different historians construct very different histories of American food and its significance


## Tech tools
- [UNM Learn](http://learn.unm.edu). All assignments will be submitted via UNM Learn.
- [Zotero](http://zotero.org); see the [getting started guide](http://fredgibbs.net/courses/etc/zotero); once connected you can access the [course library](https://www.zotero.org/groups/2499167/american-food-unm/library).

Slack is a straightforward collaborative messaging app (via your browser or app) that allows us to stay connected without more formal emails or messages in UNM Learn. I get notifications about messages so I can get back to you quickly. For personal or private issues, email is best.


## Work Requirements

### It's summer
As an upper level history course compressed into a month, this class is meant to be a challenge. But I do recognize that it's summer, that we're still recovering from last semester, that we're still living under weird circumstances, and we all have busy lives outside of class even when not amidst a pandemic. AND YET: We can work hard and learn a lot together without taking ourselves too seriously.

### It's a marathon, not a sprint
Not having actual class meetings (as the course normally does) deprives us of some collegial conversation, but it presents new freedoms as well. There isn't much to do most days except do the reading, reflect on it, write a brief response, and occasionally respond to your colleagues. There are a few slightly longer assignments that give you the chance to apply the readings more directly.

**In order to keep us learning at an even pace, the main work/fun that determines your grade are the daily reading responses.**


### Required
The little equations after the assignment type indicates `number of assignments` x `points for each` = `total points`
- [Reading responses](reading-responses) (10x4 = 40)
- Mini-lecture quizzes (4x6 = 24)
- [Weekly learning reflections](learning-reflections) (3x10 = 30)
- [Book reviews](book-reviews) (2x8 = 16)
- [Early cookbook analysis](cookbook-analysis) (1x8 = 8)
- [Food blog analysis](food-blog-analysis) (1x8 = 8)
- [Final learning reflection](learning-reflections) (1x30 = 30)

This totals 146 points, which is weird, but there's no difference between having 136 or a round number like 100. Your "grade" is determined by percent, as indicated below.

### Submitting work
The [schedule page](schedule) indicates all due dates for course work; all assignments should be uploaded to UNM Learn by the end of the day they are listed (by midnight).

### Extra Credit (all due on the Monday after the last day of class)
- [Food Documentary Critique](film-analysis) (6 points)
- Extra credit is only available if all other work is turned in on time, and should be emailed to me directly.

### Attendance
There is no formal attendance, obviously. But everyone does need to attend to and engage with our various digital platforms. These help you learn and show me you're learning---both required to get credit for the course.


## Grade yourself
As far as feedback goes, I think it's far more useful to think together and have an ongoing conversation than to give you a score or grade that supposedly indicates how "well" you're doing the assignment. **What matters most is the effort you are putting into the readings and responses, and YOU are the best person to score that.** So you will be submitting as part your assignment submission YOUR OWN SCORE that reflects the work you put into them. I will comment on whether I think your grade is vastly inappropriate given how it compares to what others are doing. With very few exceptions, **the score you give yourself is the score you get for that assignment.**

For your FINAL learning reflection, you will give yourself a grade for the course. Unless there is a serious mismatch between the quality of work you've submitted and the grade you indicate, that is the grade will get for the course.

While always a last resort, **I can always override your score on any particular assignment or on your final grade.** I will let you know whenever this happens, and you will have ample feedback as to why. For example, if you write 50 words on a 800-word assignment and give yourself the max points for that assignment, I will simply not acknowledge the legitimacy of your score and give you my own (and it will be low because you made me do it).

**I do not micromanage or nitpick points.** If I think the assignment looks like an 8 but you report your effort is worth a 9, then you get a 9. If I think the assignment looks like an 6 compared to other submissions, but you give yourself a 9, I will explain how your reported effort doesn't really match what I'm seeing from other students and encourage you to adjust it. If you give yourself an 8 but I think it's some of the best work in class, I will explain how you might be underscoring your work and encourage you to adjust it. But except for extreme cases (as noted above), you get whatever score you decide is an honest indicator of your effort. After one or two assignments (by the end of the first week), we're all pretty much on the same page.

Please trust me that the total points you earn over the month and your final grade, even when YOU determine them, will average out to almost exactly what I would have given you, even if you and I would have scored some assignments a bit differently. That's one reason there are lots of small assignments.

### Work towards YOUR needs and expectations
Some of you just want a C to fulfill a UNM requirement. Some of you want a B to maintain a solid GPA. Some of you want an A because top grades are really important to you. You all already know what your own average, good, or excellent effort feels like. So put in the work that justifies the grade you want for each assignment. There's more to learn in the class than anyone (including me) can learn in four weeks. Me evaluating you on what you've learned in an assignment---as if there are only a few ideas that worth learning---or especially over the entire month doesn't make any sense.  So you should put in the work that meets your needs and report it honestly.


### Grading and feedback are different
I don't really grade your work, but I will engage with your responses as much as possible over the course (given that there are about 60 students and I'm covid-home-schooling two toddlers). I love having conversations even on the awkward Learn Discussion Board. Please reply!

### Does this work?
It does. But you might be thinking: Why not just do the absolute minimum and give yourself max points and an A for course? Three reasons.
- 1) Integrity. That's not the kind of world anyone wants to live in, so don't do that.
- 2) Penalty. I will be forced to override your self-assessment and will likely give you a lower final grade than you yourself would have been able to justify (because you are a fraud).
- 3) Reality. Being honest about your own learning and effort---because of the self-reflection it entails---actually helps you learn more and get better at learning in general. Ultimately, the people who work at learning (with any topic) are going to be more successful in life (however you define that).


### Grading Scale

### Please Don't Drift Away
I heartily encourage you to speak with me at any time about how I think you're doing in the class and how it can be improved (if at all). If life gets overwhelming during the course, it's easy to drift away from an intensive elective course like this, especially an online course. PLEASE DON'T! Rather than disappear, let's talk about how we can accommodate your circumstances, including figuring out a target grade, reduced assignments, switching to CR/NC grade mode, etc.

### Please Ask for More Feedback
You are always welcome and encouraged to ask for MORE FEEDBACK about assignments. I do my best to respond to your work and keep a conversation going, but there's about 60 students in this class so unfortunately I can't respond to everyone everyday. But I want to make sure everyone is getting as much feedback from me as they want.



## Course Readings and Books
Most of the reading for the course are book chapters, short articles, blog posts, and the like. These are accessible through a platform called Zotero. All relevant directions are [posted here](http://fredgibbs.net/courses/etc/zotero). Once you've completed those steps, you can access our course readings [here](https://www.zotero.org/groups/2499167/american-food-unm/library).

In addition, a crucial aspect of this course is learning how to read critically about food across a variety of forms, including books. _How America Eats_ is our month-long guide that we read chapter by chapter throughout the course; two other books we'll read over the course of a week and discuss how they use food to reframe US History.

- Rude, Emelyn. _Tastes Like Chicken: A History of America’s Favorite Bird_ (Pegasus Books, 2017). [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Tastes-Like-Chicken-Americas-Favorite/dp/1681774658/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1589885368&sr=1-1)

- Specht, Joshua. _Red Meat Republic: A Hoof-to-Table History of How Beef Changed America_ (Princeton University Press, 2019). [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Red-Meat-Republic-Hoof-Table/dp/0691182310/ref=tmm_hrd_title_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1589885305&sr=1-1)

- Wallach, Jennifer Jensen  _How America Eats: A Social History of U.S. Food and Culture_ (Rowman & Littlefield Publishers, 2014). [online](https://unm-worldcat-org.libproxy.unm.edu/title/how-america-eats-a-social-history-of-us-food-and-culture/oclc/794361344&referer=brief_results)


### Familiarity over mastery
If you peek at the reading schedule page, you might think there is a lot of reading. You're right! As an intensive 1H course, there IS a lot of reading. This is unavoidable because I respect the challenges and demands of a compressed four-week course that ostensibly provides comparable intellectual rigor as a full-semester course. But the workload is comparable to any average 1H upper-level humanities course, whether in person or online.

Obviously we can't just quadruple the reading load for each day. So, it's not quite double that of a typical upper-level history course. Even then, you cannot possibly read every word, or every page, or master all the ideas, **and that's just fine**. I DO expect you to gain a familiarity across all the readings so that you can write a thoughtful response about them. Because we're covering so much ground so quickly, broad familiarity is far more important than specific details (although hopefully some historical detail will stick with you).


### Rethinking literacy
True literacy is not just understanding words and sentences. It's being able to read relatively quickly, think critically about what you read, and take away something useful from it (or decide you don't need to).

Almost all readings are meant for a broad (largely non-academic) audience and therefore are relatively quick and engaging reads. At the same time, they are smart, articulate, and give us plenty to talk about, especially as we put them in conversation with each other, and how they tell very different stories of American Food.

You don't have to read every word carefully to take away some useful ideas from the readings. You simply need to read enough and carefully enough to form an opinion on how the authors approach their topics, what kind of argument they make, what kinds of sources they use, how they differ from each other, why you do or don't like it, etc. This is what you'll be writing about in your reading responses.
