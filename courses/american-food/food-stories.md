# American Food Stories
We've talked a little about the absence and fragility of historical archives about what people actually ate. It can be hard to know! So let's make life easier for future food historians.


## Why we're doing this
- Consider the nature of food archives
- Document NM food history
- Basic experience with sound editing
- Participate and reflect on a collaborative public history project


## What you will do
- Record ~6 minutes of someone or yourself discussion a food tradition. 
- Use basic sound editing software to clean it up (this takes about 30 minutes)
- Write up a ~500 word analysis based on course themes to contextualize your audio clip
- Use AI to generate some goofy image related to your food topic
- Create a simple webpage to host your interview clip and your blurb and image.
- **YOU WILL HAVE DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS FOR EVERY STEP**



## Questions to keep in mind for your analysis
- Who is the intended audience? What do they (the audience) know? 
- What kind of assumptions does the author(s) make about cooking/cuisine/food?
- What kind of larger themes appear (exotic, health, comfort, economy, speed, etc)?
- Are the various "national" or "ethnic" influences of the recipes or instructions?
- How much does tradition or originality or authenticity matter?  
- Do you think your blogs help construct an American, regional, or family identity?
- REMEMBER: You're READING BETWEEN THE LINES to learn about American culture and cuisine.


## Questions
Writing is hard enough, and virtually impossible when you're not sure what you're trying to do. Please get in touch!
