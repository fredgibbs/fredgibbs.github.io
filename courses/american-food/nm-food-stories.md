# NM Food Stories
The assignment asks you to record an oral history of some local food traditions. 

## Why we're doing this
- Consider the nature of food archives
- Document NM food history
- Basic experience with sound editing
- Participate and reflect on a collaborative public history project

Coordinate with our TA Korey and Amaranth

text to speech for analysis?
what do we do with the collection?
how to use the class to analyze / comment / understand?



## Basics
- ~800 words. But quality is more important than quantity.
- At the top of your essay, put a functional hyperlink to the blogs you reference
- Be sure you're well acquainted with the Method and Questions sections below.

## Method
- Remind yourself what we did with the early cookbook analysis. You're basically doing the same thing here with a slight twist.
- Identify TWO food blogs that you want to skim through (I think the assignment is more fun if you skim through a few more, since you'll have more to draw from).
  - If you are already familiar with some blogs, feel free to use them.
  - If you don't know of any blogs right now, you can find collections of food blog links [here](https://americanfoodbloggers.com/) and [here](https://bloggingtips.com/best-food-blogs/) and [here](https://www.chefspencil.com/best-30-food-blogs-in-2020/). You'll notice there is a lot of overlap on these. The particular sites you use are of no consequence, but it's best to avoid super specialized ones for the purposes of this exercise.
- Click through the blogs (especially the "about" pages, a handful of recipes, photography, etc) to get a sense of what each is trying to do. Think about tone, style, assumptions about food, cooking, etc.
- Make sure you're addressing the questions below!


## Questions to keep in mind
- Who is the intended audience? (For instance: What do they (the audience) know? Are they intimidated by cooking? Are they already proficient cooks?)
- What kind of assumptions does the author(s) make about cooking/cuisine/food?
- What kind of larger themes do the blogs appeal to (exotic, health, comfort, economy, speed, etc)?
- What are the various "national" or "ethnic" influences of the recipes or instructions?
- How much does tradition or originality or authenticity matter to the author?  
- Do you think your blogs help construct an American identity or a sense of "American food"?
- Just like we looked at cookbooks from ~150 years ago to learn about food at the time, what would a historian 150 years from now think American food if looking at your blogs?
- REMEMBER: You're READING BETWEEN THE LINES to learn about American culture and cuisine.


## Questions
Writing is hard enough, and virtually impossible when you're not sure what you're trying to do. Please get in touch!
