# Food Blog Analysis
This assignment encourages you to bring what we've learned in class in critiquing and analyzing how references to health and diet appear in a popular contemporary source---in this case a food blog. Even if you've never read or thought about one, food blogs are VERY popular and play a significant role in shaping our perceptions about diet and health, even when the blogs themselves aren't about that specifically.

## Basics
- ~800 words
- Posted on the discussion board as usual


## What to do (YOUR CHOICE)
- Find a food blog. It can be one you already read or use regularly, or it can be something totally random that you've never seen before. If you need to find one, just google "popular food blog" and pick a site from the search results, or pick a site from one of the "best" lists that show up.
- Note that most blogs are not specifically about health (feel free to choose one that is, however). THAT IS FINE!
- Your blog might mention health very scarcely---THAT IS ALSO FINE!
- Click through the about page, the recipes, read the descriptions, read the comments, etc. Get familiar with the whole thing so that you have a solid impression of how the blog/author describes the relationship between diet and health.

### OR
- Identify several (3-5) food blogs (using the method above) that you want to skim through. Again, these can be ones you already know or ones that you've never seen before.
- Click through the blogs to get a sense of what each is trying to do. Think about tone, style, assumptions about diet and health, rhetoric, etc.
- Instead of writing about a single blog, write up a comparison of how the different blogs make reference to diet and health. They might be more or less the same; they might be VERY different. Make sure you post is about comparing and contrasting them.



## Questions to ask your blog and write about
- What kind of assumptions does the author(s) make about the relationship between food, diet, health?
- What kinds of claims about diet and health does the author make? What kind of evidence is used to support these claims?
- Who is the intended audience? What do they know? What do they care about? (as implied from the blog)
- How does the author established their credibility or authority about diet and health?

## MOST IMPORTANT QUESTION(s) TO ADDRESS
- How does your food blog reflect contemporary attitudes toward diet and health? Or not?


## Grading
- 9-10: **Excellent**. Spent significant time with your blog, and wrote up an original, expressive, and sophisticated analysis of what we can learn about diet and health from it.
- 7-8: **Very good**. Read the blog thoroughly, with partial answers to the above questions.
- 4-6: **Fine**. Read the blog unevenly, but your analysis shows that you're starting to think critically about the questions above.
- 1-3: **Marginal**. Skimmed the blog quickly and your analysis provides a coherent but rather simplistic description of its contents.


## Questions
You are ALWAYS welcome to use email or better yet Slack for questions or clarifications. Writing is hard enough, and virtually impossible when you're not sure what you're trying to do. Please get in touch!
