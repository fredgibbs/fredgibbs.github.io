# HIST 410: Week 16

## Review and Reflection 2
{% include alert.html class='warning' title='Nothing Due This Week' text="
If you're catching up from last week, you'll need to watch the [future of nutrition article critique](https://youtu.be/xfKv2uNLbp8)--the way I see the article you critiqued before Thanksgiving week (Mozaffarian, et al.) and how it fits into the course. Essential viewing for a successful final. As with last week, you can see from the box below what the original assignment was going to be, but I honestly don't think it's useful at this point. SO IT'S CANCELLED. The whole week. WORK ON YOUR FINAL!

We have read a lot about explicit dietary advice, but obviously a lot of what we \"know\" about health and diet comes not just from contemporary research, but the long history of how we have thought about diet and health. How does the HISTORY that we've covered help explain why diet advice looks like it does? Your only thing to do this week is a [Healthy Diet Analysis](healthy-diet-analysis).
