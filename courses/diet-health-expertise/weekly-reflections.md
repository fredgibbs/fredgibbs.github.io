# Weekly Learning Reflections

## Objectives
These reflections are a personal reflection about what you've learned over the week, and serve as a way of tying together different readings on a similar theme.


## Basics
- ~600--800 words (a broad range because some days you'll have more to say than others)
- Free of typos and basic grammatical errors
- Posted on the discussion board by MIDNIGHT on FRIDAYS (unless otherwise noted on the syllabus)


## What you need to do:
There are two facets to these posts, so you should divide your post roughly in two halves.
- For the first 300 words, address the question(s) on the syllabus for that Friday.
- For the second 300 words, describe your own learning experience with the readings for the week. You might write about some combination of the following:
  - What ideas from the readings did you find most interesting? Why?
  - Conversely, what was least interesting to you? Why?
  - What challenges did you encounter with the readings?



## Reflect more than summarize
For both parts of your reflection, I'm much more interested in reading about YOUR PERSONAL LEARNING EXPERIENCE than reading a summary of the readings. Of course in addressing the questions or describing what you found most interesting, you'll end up restating some ideas from some of the readings. That's important! But this exercise is NOT about just regurgitating the readings or identifying the "most" important points---everyone will learn something different from them.

# Final Learning Reflection
This is basically the same as the weekly reflections as described above, except it should be 1200 words long and cover the ENTIRE COURSE. The one key difference is that you will will make an argument for what letter grade you should get for the course and justify it by explaining what you've learned based on the effort you've put in (as described above). So you want to describe your learning experience and to provide specific examples of what you've learned throughout the course. How has your perspective on diet and health changed? How is your understanding of expertise any different?

To explain what you've learned is NOT THE SAME as summarizing or paraphrasing the syllabus. Illustrating how your thinking about the SLOs (Student Learning Objectives) has changed, or describing why you think the readings were ineffective, is much more personal and shows a much greater depth of learning than simply listing topics possibly can.

I can't emphasize enough that these should be personal statements about YOUR LEARNING EXPERIENCE, not just a summary of course topics and themes. If you are describing your EXPERIENCE with the readings and the course overall, you'll end up including plenty of information from the course. If all you do is summarize readings without including your reaction to them, describing how it changed your thinking, or why it didn't (again, either is fine), I can only assume that you didn't put in very much effort to learn anything.

This isn't a writing class so you're not getting evaluated on elegant prose. BUT, your writing must be clear enough that I can follow the thread of your argument. Your final reflection should be well thought out and carefully written, not a stream of consciousness off-the-cuff here’s what I remember type thing. The quality of your final essay should be reflective of your effort to learn in the course. Even if you’re going for a C, this is your last chance to make sure you get at least that. You should invest a few hours time skimming through the readings again---not re-reading them---to remind yourself what you did, or maybe reading a little more of something you totally skimmed.


## Make an argument for your OVERALL GRADE
You should start your paper with a statement of what grade you think you have earned based on your EFFORT (not just what your scores are so far). Then you should go on to explain how things went for you.

A VERY skeletal example (condensing a whole essay into a paragraph):

I think I earned a B+. I learned to think about X more carefully because of E. I realized I hadn't ever thought about Y in terms of F before, but that it's important because of Z. Those issues are also relevant to F and G, because of H and J. I also was really interested in reading about Q because of T; I liked how the reading on R made me think about U differently, even though that was contradicted by S. I enjoyed the readings A, B, and C because of X and Y, as they made me question assumptions M and N that I had initially. I disagreed with the D reading because of O and S. I disagreed with the B reading because of X, but liked how it described Z. I would have liked to spend more time with some of the topics, such as P, Q, and R, but I had to pick up extra shifts at work, so some of my reflections were a little thin on those days. I had a hard time following the lecture on F, so my quiz score was low, but I thought it was interesting how A and B from the lecture connected with M and N from the C and D readings. I thought the readings on J had some good ideas but I found the writing hard to follow (for example when the author discusses G), and so I didn't incorporate them into my reflections. But I was really into J and K, and thought I wrote some of the more interesting posts of the class, particularly my analysis of G and H. I thought it was interesting how topics L and M from the first week intersected with T and U from the third week in the sense of P and Q.

Obviously you'll have SIGNIFICANTLY more depth to your description in the sense that all the letters above will be well-explained and specific examples from the readings---and they won't all be crammed into a single sentence as I have done. What what is one sentence above should be a whole paragraph in your reflection.

NOTE: Don't just talk about how great your work has been (even if true). That's already posted, evaluated, etc. This final learning reflection is meant to convey your synthesis of the whole course and give me an honest assessment your effort, even if it wasn't apparent in some of your posts (which happens to ALL of us).


### Be specific
This is what separates excellent from mediocre reflections. To say that "I learned to think more critically about dietary advice" is fine ONLY AS LONG AS you provide several specific examples of the issues that you think are important to think critically about and WHY. But if you just leave it at that (the vague statement that you learned about a topic on the syllabus) and don't provide any examples from the readings, I can only assume it's because you didn't read or learn very much.


### Think holistically
The more you can tie themes together and speak about the course as a whole (while giving specific examples from the readings), the higher your score will be. You should absolutely use the discussion board to remind you of what was going on over the many weeks of class.
