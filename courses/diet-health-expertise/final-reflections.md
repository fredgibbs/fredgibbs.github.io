# Final Learning Reflection
Your final assignment for the course is a bit different from previous assignments. I'd like you to write a ~1200-word course reflection, with two main components (and maybe a little of a third depending on whether you're satisfied with your current grade). You can do these sections separately, or they can be totally integrated. I don't care much about the form as long as you're addressing the issues suggested below.

## Describe what you learned
Using specific examples from the reading and connecting larger across themes as done in the overview videos, tell me what you learned in the course. Don't forget the big picture questions (review the Course Goals!), such as:
- How has dietary advice stayed the same over the centuries? How has it remained the same?
- How is your understanding of how expertise is created different than before? 
- How can you analyze the rhetoric of diet and health differently now? 
- How can the history of diet and health help us contextualize contemporary dietary debates?

## Describe your learning experience
Describe your learning experience in the course. This is obviously a totally subjective question and there's no right answer. Some questions to consider:
- What was your learning experience like in this course?
- What topics were interesting? Which weren't?
- Which assignments seemed to help you learn? Which seemed a waste of time?
- Where did the course flow together well? Where did it seem disconnected?

Allow me to emphasize that you should not simply summarize course topics and themes. You should use specific examples from the course readings. If all you do is summarize some readings without including your reaction to them (unfavorable reactions are fine!), I can only assume that you didn't put in very much effort into the course.

This isn't a writing class so you're not getting evaluated on elegant prose. BUT, your writing must be clear enough that I can follow your argument and your survey of course themes. Your final reflection should be well thought out and carefully written, not a stream of consciousness off-the-cuff hereâ€™s-what-I-remember type thing. 

## Make an argument for a grade
The third and optional component is to make a brief argument for what letter grade you should get for the course. It's maybe a weird request for a final, but there is a specific reason: your effort to learn, and what you actually did learn, might not be represented in your final point tally. This assignment gives you a chance to argue that you've put more work in or learned more than your numbers indicate.

To be clear, you aren't necessarily going to get whatever grade you ask for. But if you have gotten lower scores, but write a very smart final that uses lots of examples from the readings as evidence for your familiarity with them and connects reading material as done in the overview vidfeos, you will likely get a higher grade than your raw point total suggests.



## Pro tips

### Take time to review
Before you start writing, invest a few hours to REVISIT THE READINGS. This does not mean re-reading them, but just reminding yourself what you've read, or maybe reading a little more of something you could only skim before. Course videos can be tedious, but they all try to pull together broader themes and explain how different weeks and topics fit together. Seeing some of the first readings after having done the course is a very different experience than when you first read them.


### Be Specific
Specificity and clarity (in thinking and organization) is what separates excellent from mediocre work. To say that "I learned to think more critically about fad diets" will sound unconvincing unless you provide several SPECIFIC examples of the issues that you think are important to think critically about and WHY. If you just make a vague statement that you learned about a topic on the syllabus and you don't provide any examples from the readings, or don't connect different readings together, I can only assume it's because you don't know them very well.


### Think holistically
I hope you will use your final learning reflection to CONNECT DIFFERENT TOPICS AND THEMES AND READINGS for the course. The more you can tie themes together and speak about the course as a whole (while giving specific examples from the readings---yes, I'm going to keep repeating it), the better you'll do. Essays that speak very generally about one topic after the other in the order of the syllabus will make a case that you haven't really made any connections. When I see those connections in your final, I know you're putting in the work to make them.


### Make an impression; 50 points go a long way
I know everyone is fried at this point, and it's therefore tempting to just bulldoze through the assignment to be done with the course. I GET IT! But taking some time to think back through the course makes a big difference in what you take away from it. I wouldn't bother with this assignment if I didn't think it made a big impact.


## Grading
This is a ballpark scale just to give you an idea of how I see the difference between points/grades for this kind of assignment.

- 42-50: **Excellent**. Presents an original, expressive, and sophisticated analysis of what you've learned and how the readings relate to each other. It combines many specific examples from the readings with a detailed personal narrative of how they affected (or didn't) effect your thinking about diet and health.
- 36-41: **Very good**. Provides excellent coverage of course topics, themes, and readings, with more than a few specific examples, connects readings from throughout the course, and demonstrates a clear emphasis on creating a learning reflection rather than course summary. Seems a little lacking in comparison to the best essays.
- 30-35: **Fine**. Provides solid coverage of course topics, themes, and readings---with some examples---but tends more towards vague summary than making specific points and describing a learning experience.
- 25-29: **Marginal**. Shows some evidence of thinking critically about core topics from the course, covers a wide variety of course themes, but does not demonstrate much knowledge of course content beyond superficial descriptions.
- < 25: **Failure**. Incoherent, overly general summary of some topics, many topics missing, minimal examples or engagement with readings.
