# Healthy Diet Analysis
This assignment encourages you to bring what we've learned in class in critiquing and analyzing how references to health and diet appear in contemporary literature---a webpage/website (of your choosing) that discusses what a "healthy diet" is. This assignment is a lot like the vitamin rhetoric analysis, but is made to help you reflect on the entire course and how the history of diet and health can help us understand contemporary advice and understandings of diet and health.

## Basics
- ~800 words
- Clear paragraphs that answer the questions below
- Posted on the discussion board as usual

## What to do
- Google something like "what is a healthy diet?"
- Pick one of the results
- Get familiar with the whole thing so that you have a solid impression of how the blog/author describes the relationship between diet and health
- IGNORE the actual diet advice in terms of whether you think it's "right" or "good" or not. That is irrelevant for the assignment.


## Questions to ask your blog and write about
- What kind of assumptions does the author(s) make about the relationship between food, diet, health?
- What kinds of claims about diet and health does the author make? What kind of evidence is used to support these claims? Is there room for misinterpretation?
- How does the author establish their credibility or authority about diet and health?
- Who is the intended audience? What do they know? What does this audience care about?
- Is it convincing? Why? Does the advice stem from expertise or common sense?

## MOST IMPORTANT QUESTION TO ADDRESS
- How does the HISTORY of diet and health as we've covered it explain why your webpage looks the way it does?

Think about all the topics and themes we've covered and how we've seen elements of your webpage in historical context before: balance, common sense, expertise, calories, fat, quantification, measurement, science, evidence, etc.


## Grading
- 9-10: **Excellent**. Wrote up an original, expressive, and sophisticated analysis of how the course (the history of diet and health) can help explain why a modern webpage gives the advice that it does.
- 7-8: **Very good**. Provides partial, but informed answers to the above questions.
- 4-6: **Fine**. Shows some evidence of thinking critically about the above questions, but does not demonstrate much knowledge of course content.
- 1-3: **Marginal**. Provides simplistic descriptions and superficial answers to questions that are disconnected from course material.


## Questions
You are ALWAYS welcome to use email or better yet Slack for questions or clarifications. Writing is hard enough, and virtually impossible when you're not sure what you're trying to do. Please get in touch!
