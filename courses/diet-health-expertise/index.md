## Course Description
If someone tells you how to eat or what you should or shouldn’t eat, do you believe them? Why or why not? Is any dietary advice ever truly "right"? What makes some more convincing than others? This course uses the long history of diet and health to investigate the relationship between medical expertise and popular understandings of health.

Some guiding questions: How do dietary experts establish their expertise? Why have medical authorities continually redefined what it means to be healthy and to eat a healthy diet?  Why have so many fad diets come into and gone out of fashion?  What can historical perspectives on topics like GMOs, vitamins, and obesity offer contemporary debates on these issues?


## Student Learning Objectives
* 1: Question and judge the extent to which ideas of health are constructed as much socially and culturally as scientifically
* 2: Interpret and explain the rhetoric of health in different historical periods
* 3: Outline how the establishment of dietary expertise has and has not changed over time
* 4: Sharpen critical thinking about diet/health/expertise
* 5: Advance historical source analysis skills by evaluating primary sources on dietary advice


## You are welcome here
This class is probably unlike most history classes you've taken because the history of medicine and history of food are somewhat specialized topics. But I want to be VERY CLEAR: Even if you have never thought about the history of medicine or diet, or have never taken a history course, or even a humanities course, YOU ARE WELCOME HERE! I assume you have no prior knowledge or skills necessary for class, so we build from the ground up.

I will do everything I can do help you learn as much as you're motivated to learn, and to help you get whatever grade you're aiming for. As much as possible I've tried to make the course about everyone thinking together rather than just you memorizing something I say or you read so that you can regurgitate it later. If you feel the course structure isn't facilitating your own success, let's talk (virtually, of course)!

## Getting Started
This page, and the [schedule page](schedule), have all the instructions and assignments you need for the course. Make sure you are VERY FAMILIAR with these two pages. We use UNM Learn to manage quizzes, assignment submissions, and the discussion board, but all basic course information is on these two webpages.

### Course Readings
We use a tool called [Zotero](http://zotero.org) to access PDFs for the course. We have what's called a group library that holds all the readings for the course. FIRST, to get connected, see the [getting started guide](http://fredgibbs.net/courses/etc/zotero).

Once you've completed the steps in the guide (it takes maybe 5 minutes), you can access the [course library](https://www.zotero.org/groups/642043/diet-health-expertise-unm/library). This link is also on UNM Learn and on the Links and Guides page for this course (see link at very top of page).

NOTE: ALL course readings not already online will be ONLY available through Zotero (unless you track them down on your own, which you should never need to do).

#### Quick Zotero Info
- Group Library Name: `diet-health-expertise-unm` (in case you need to look it up on zotero.org)
- Group Library URL: [https://www.zotero.org/groups/642043/diet-health-expertise-unm](https://www.zotero.org/groups/642043/diet-health-expertise-unm). Remember that you can only see the group library if you have joined it.


## General Work outline
While we have no formal meetings, the class is organized around modest reading assignments almost everyday. The frequency of written responses generally decreases as the semester progresses.


### Reading Reflections
I hold you accountable for keeping up with the readings by asking you to respond to them with short [reading reflections](reading-reflections). Some weeks you'll instead post a [weekly learning reflection](weekly-reflections) that will address a few questions that will help tie together some recent readings. In place of a few weekly learning reflections there are other assignments to spice things up a bit.

All assignments are DUE BY MIDNIGHT on the day they are listed on the syllabus. Let me know if something is not clear!


### Lecture Videos
There will be short lecture videos to watch almost every week. Sometimes these will be overviews for the week; sometimes they will be weekly reviews that comment on your reading reflections; sometimes they will go over a quiz. I try to keep them about ~20 minutes, but there are a few slightly longer ones, when I needed a bit more time to get through the material. I am aware that watching videos of me talking is not super (or even vaguely) interesting, so I try to provide what I think is most neeeded while be respectful of your time and the awkwardness of watching a talking head on a screen.

## Places to Find Stuff
- [Canvas @ UNM](http://canvas.unm.edu). All assignments will be submitted and graded via Canvas.
- [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCt6_7arYzi4TcIIwo7TLURw) will host mini-lectures and other screencasts. I highly recommend that you either subscribe or bookmark the channel so you have quick access to it.


## Required Texts
There are NO REQUIRED BOOKS OR READERS for the course; everything is accessible online. However, you will need to accept an invitation to join the course Zotero library to access many of the assigned articles and book chapters. See the Tech Tools section above for instructions and links.

TO BE CLEAR: LITERALLY EVERYTHING you need for the course is either already freely available online (and linked to on the syllabus), or is a PDF in our Zotero library. If you ever think you need to track something down on your own, you are not connected to Zotero properly.


## Work Requirements and Grading
Assignments are usually worth either 2 points (weekly discussion posts), 10 points (weekly learning reflections; although sometimes these are 12 or 15), or 20 points (for larger, special assignments)

The little equations after the assignment type indicates `number of assignments` x `points for each` x `weight` = `total points`
- Occasional reading/lecture quizzes (~6x~10 = ~60)
- [Reading reflections](reading-reflections)(16x2 = 32)
- [Weekly learning reflections](weekly-reflections) (11x10 = 110) (usually in response to a particular question) Due most Fridays.
- [Healthy diet analysis](healthy-diet-analysis) (1x15 = 15) Due in lieu of a weekly reflection on the last day of class.
- [Final learning reflection](final-reflections) (1x30 = 30) Due on the last official day of the 2H summer term. This is not a huge chunk of your grade, but this is the last chance to increase your point total for the course.


### Grade Distribution
Depending on how the course unfolds, the final number of points may ( = will almost certainly) change slightly. But the percent grading scale will remain basically the same, unless it becomes easier to get a higher grade. I try to minimize grade scale changes, but sometimes they are necessary and they always work to your advantage.

Percent | Grade
--- | ---
95+ | A
90-94 | A-
87-89 | B+
83-86 | B
80-82 | B-
77-79 | C+
73-76 | C
70-72 | C-
67-69 | D+
60-66 | D
59- | F


### Response times
I try to respond to all emails ASAP, but it can take up to 2 days for longer inquires. Quick questions about assignments or deadlines or similar tend to be answered within a few hours. I try to grade assignments and provide feedback within 3 days of the assignment due date. It's not feasible to comment on everyone's work for each assignment (everyone gets comments on larger assignments), but I encourage you to ask for more feedback whether you get any or not. I'm always happy to have a conversation about your work and how I'm responding to it.


### Extra Credit (due the last day of finals)
- [Diet/Health/Food Documentary Critique](film-analysis) (4 points)
- Other ideas? If you are interested in a particular topic related to the class and want to do a little extra work for some extra points, ask me about it! I'm quite flexible about helping people to work they are excited about that contributed to the learning objectives of the course. Even extra credit gets graded, though, so just doing something for the sake of doing it (as opposed to doing it well) doesn't necessarily get you many points. Email these to me directly. 
- CAREFUL: Extra credit is only available if all other work is turned in!

## Writing Help
