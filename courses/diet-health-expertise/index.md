# Diet, Health, and Expertise

## Logistics
- HIST 410-001; CRN: 68708
- Remote arranged; asynchronous (no set meeting times)
- 3 Credit Hours
- Fred Gibbs \([fwgibbs@unm.edu](mailto:fwgibbs@unm.edu)\) @ Mesa Vista Hall, 1077 (but I'll never be there, so we're using Slack as noted in the Tech tools section below)


## Course Description
If someone tells you how to eat or what you should or shouldnâ€™t eat, do you believe them? Why or why not? Is any dietary advice ever truly "right"? What makes some more convincing than others? This course uses the long history of diet and health to investigate the relationship between medical expertise and popular understandings of health.

Some guiding questions: Why have medical authorities continually redefined what it means to be healthy and to eat a healthy diet? How do dietary experts establish their expertise? Why have so many fad diets come into and gone out of fashion?  What can historical perspectives on topics like GMOs, vitamins, and obesity offer contemporary debates on these issues?


## Student Learning Outcomes
* Interpret and explain the rhetoric of health in different historical periods
* Sharpen critical thinking and historical source analysis skills by evaluating primary sources on dietary advice
* Question and judge the extent to which ideas of health are constructed as much socially and culturally as well as scientifically
* Describe and analyze how ideas of healthy diets have changed over time


## You are welcome here
This class is probably unlike most history classes you've taken, since history and medicine and history of food are somewhat specialized topics. It's also a 400-level class, which can seem intimidating. Even if you have never taken a history course before, or even many humanities courses, you are welcome here and I will do everything I can do help you get whatever grade you're aiming for. As much as possible I've tried to make the course about everyone thinking together rather than just you memorizing something I say so that you can regurgitate it later.


## Getting Started
This page, and the [schedule page](schedule), have all the instructions and assignments you need for the course. Make sure you are VERY FAMILIAR with these two pages. We use UNM Learn to manage quizzes, assignment submissions, and the discussion board, but all basic course information is on these two (separate) webpages.


## Tech tools
- [UNM Learn](http://learn.unm.edu). All assignments will be submitted via UNM Learn.
- [Zotero](http://zotero.org); see the [getting started guide](http://fredgibbs.net/courses/etc/zotero); once connected you can access the [course library](https://www.zotero.org/groups/642043/diet-health-expertise-unm/library).
- [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCt6_7arYzi4TcIIwo7TLURw) will host mini-lectures and other screencasts. I will post announcements of new videos in Learn (which send an email to you as well). I highly recommend that you either subscribe or bookmark the channel so you have quick access to it.
- [Slack channel](http://diet-health-expertise.slack.com); first click the [invitation link](https://join.slack.com/t/diet-health-expertise/shared_invite/zt-fr3dhvtx-a3KB6TvgydhGhf9p6yYlxQ). Slack is a straightforward collaborative messaging platform (via your browser or desktop/mobile app) that allows us to stay connected and communicate quickly without the hassle of formal emails or UNM Learn. I keep an eye out for notifications so I can get back to you quickly.


### It's a (virtual) marathon, not a sprint
Not having actual class meetings (as the course normally does) deprives us of some collegial conversation, but it presents new freedoms as well. There isn't much to do most days except do the reading, reflect on it, write a brief response, and occasionally respond to your colleagues. There are a few slightly longer assignments that give you the chance to apply the readings more directly.

**In order to keep us learning at an even pace, the main work/fun that determines your grade is the weekly learning reflections.** I've deliberately avoided disproportionately large midterms or finals.


## Required Texts
There are no required books or readers for the course; everything is accessible online. However, you will need to accept an invitation to join the course Zotero library to access many of the assigned articles and book chapters. See the Tech Tools section above for instructions and links.

TO BE CLEAR: LITERALLY EVERYTHING you need for the course is either already freely available online, or is a PDF in our Zotero library. If you ever think you need to track something down on your own, you are not connected to Zotero properly.



## Work Requirements and Grading
All assignments are scored on a 0-10 scale, but assignments count differently towards your final grade (that is, some are weighted to count more because they are more significant).

The little equations after the assignment type indicates `number of assignments` x `points for each` x `weight` = `total points`
- Occasional reading/lecture quizzes (8x10x.5 = 40)
- [Reading connections](reading-connections)(12x2 = 24)
- [Weekly learning reflections](learning-reflections) (13x10 = 130) (usually in response to a particular question)
- [Food blog analysis](food-blog-analysis) (1x10 = 10)
- [Final learning reflection](learning-reflections) (1x20 = 20)


### Extra Credit (all due on the Monday after the last day of class)
- [Food Documentary Critique](film-analysis) (4 points)
- Other ideas? If you are interested in a particular topic related to the class and want to do a little extra work for some extra points, ask me about it! I'm quite flexible about helping people to work they are excited about that contributed to the learning objectives of the course. Even extra credit gets graded, though, so just doing something for the sake of doing it (as opposed to doing it well) doesn't necessarily get you many points.
- CAREFUL: Extra credit is only available if all other work is turned in on time, and should be emailed to me directly. You can't use extra credit to make up for other assignments you don't like (sorry if you don't like them, but they are still important).


## Course Readings and Schedule
View the [schedule page](schedule) for all reading assignments, reading reflection prompts (all submitted via UNM Learn), and due dates (usually Friday).
