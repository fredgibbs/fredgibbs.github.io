# Diet, Health, and Expertise

## Logistics
- HIST 410 | Fall 2020
- Remote arranged; asynchronous (no set meeting times)
- 3 Credit Hours
- Fred Gibbs \([fwgibbs@unm.edu](mailto:fwgibbs@unm.edu)\) @ Mesa Vista Hall, 1077


## Course Description
If someone tells you how to eat or what you should or shouldnâ€™t eat, do you believe them? Why or why not? Is dietary advice ever truly believable? This course uses the long history of diet and health to investigate the relationship between medical expertise and popular understandings of health.

Some guiding questions: How do dietary experts establish their expertise? Why have medical authorities continually redefined what it means to be healthy and to eat a healthy diet? Why have so many fad diets come into and gone out of fashion?  What can historical perspectives on topics like GMOs, vitamins, and obesity offer contemporary debates on these issues?


## Student Learning Outcomes
* Describe and analyze how ideas of healthy diets have changed over time
* Interpret and explain the rhetoric of health in different historical periods
* Sharpen critical thinking and historical source analysis skills by evaluating primary sources on dietary advice
* Question and judge the extent to which ideas of health are constructed as much socially and culturally as well as scientifically


## Getting Started
This page, and the [schedule page](schedule), have all the instructions and assignments you need for the course. Make sure you are very familiar with these two pages. We use UNM Learn to manage quizzes, assignment submissions, and the discussion board, but all course information is on these two pages.

## Tech tools
- [UNM Learn](http://learn.unm.edu). All assignments will be submitted via UNM Learn.
- [Zotero](http://zotero.org); see the [getting started guide](http://fredgibbs.net/courses/etc/zotero); once connected you can access the [course library](https://www.zotero.org/groups/2499167/american-food-unm/library).
- [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCt6_7arYzi4TcIIwo7TLURw) will host mini-lectures and other screencasts. I will post announcements of new videos in Learn (which send an email to you as well). I highly recommend that you either subscribe or bookmark the channel so you have quick access to it.
- [Slack channel](http://diet-health-expertise.slack.com; first click the [invitation link](https://join.slack.com/t/diet-health-expertise/shared_invite/zt-fr3dhvtx-a3KB6TvgydhGhf9p6yYlxQ). Slack is a straightforward collaborative messaging platform (via your browser or desktop/mobile app) that allows us to stay connected without the hassle of formal emails or messages in UNM Learn. I get notifications about messages so I can get back to you quickly.


### It's a marathon, not a sprint
Not having actual class meetings (as the course normally does) deprives us of some collegial conversation, but it presents new freedoms as well. There isn't much to do most days except do the reading, reflect on it, write a brief response, and occasionally respond to your colleagues. There are a few slightly longer assignments that give you the chance to apply the readings more directly.

**In order to keep us learning at an even pace, the main work/fun that determines your grade are the daily reading responses.**


## Required Texts
There are no required books for the course. However, you will need to subscribe to the course Zotero library to access assigned articles. See the Tech Tools section above.



## Work Requirements and Grading
All assignments are scored on a 0-10 scale, but assignments count differently (ie they are weighted) towards your final grade.

The little equations after the assignment type indicates `number of assignments` x `points for each` x `weight` = `total points`
- [Reading/lecture quizzes](reading-responses) (8x10x.5 = 40)
- [Weekly learning reflections](learning-reflections) (13x10 = 130) (usually in response to a particular question that encourages you to connect the readings.)
- [Food blog analysis](food-blog-analysis) (1x10 = 10)
- End of semester review exercises (2x10 = 20)
- [Final learning reflection](learning-reflections) (1x30 = 30)
[keep food blog analysis but with health focus ]

### Extra Credit (all due on the Monday after the last day of class)
- [Food Documentary Critique](film-analysis) (5 points)
- Extra credit is only available if all other work is turned in on time, and should be emailed to me directly.


## Syllabus
View the [schedule page](schedule) for all reading assignments, reading reflection prompts (all submitted via UNM Learn), and due dates (usually Friday).
