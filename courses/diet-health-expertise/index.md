# HIST 410: History of Diet and Health

## Logistics
- HIST 410-001; CRN: 68708
- 3 Credit Hours
- Remote arranged; asynchronous (no set meeting times)
- Prof. Fred Gibbs \([fwgibbs@unm.edu](mailto:fwgibbs@unm.edu)\)


## Course Description
If someone tells you how to be healthy or what you should or shouldn’t eat, do you believe them? Why or why not? How do dietary "experts" establish their expertise? What makes some people/arguments more convincing than others? Is any dietary advice ever truly "right"? What happens during the process of translating nutrition and diet research into everyday action? How have ideas about healthy diets and healthy bodies changed over time?

This course uses the long history of diet and health to investigate the relationship between popular understandings of health and the idea of expertise.


## Student Learning Outcomes
1. Describe how ideas of health have been historically constructed both culturally and scientifically
2. Sharpen critical thinking about the relationship between diet, health, and expertise 
3. Interpret and explain the how rhetoric of health varies across different historical periods
4. Critically evaluate dietary advice in broad historical context


## You are welcome here
Even if you have never thought about the history of medicine or diet or health, or have never taken a history course, or even a humanities course, YOU ARE WELCOME HERE! I assume you have no prior knowledge or skills necessary for class, so we build from the ground up.

I will do everything I can do help you learn as much as you're motivated to learn, and to help you get whatever grade you're aiming for. As much as possible I've tried to make the course about everyone thinking together rather than just you learning "facts" that you can regurgitate later. If you feel the course structure isn't facilitating your own success, please let me know what would!

## Getting Started
- The course syllabus is this page and the [schedule page](schedule). These two pages have everything you need to know about the course. It is YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to know what's on the syllabus and follow directions. 

- All assignments will be submitted and graded via [Canvas](http://canvas.unm.edu). 

- All course videos are available on YouTube. Links to videos will be posted on the syllabus, and you can also subscribe to or bookmark the course [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCt6_7arYzi4TcIIwo7TLURw) for quick access.


### Required Texts
There are NO REQUIRED BOOKS OR READERS for the course; everything is accessible online. LITERALLY EVERYTHING you need for the course is either already available online (and linked to on the syllabus), or is a PDF in our Zotero library as described below. If you ever think you need to track something down on your own, YOU ARE WRONG.

### Course Readings
We use a tool called [Zotero](http://zotero.org) to organize and provide access to all readings for the course. FIRST, to get connected, see the [getting started guide](http://fredgibbs.net/courses/guides/zotero).

Once you've completed the steps in the guide (it takes maybe 2 minutes), you can access the [course library](https://www.zotero.org/groups/642043/diet-health-expertise-unm/library). 

NOTE: ALL course readings not already online are available through Zotero. **You should never need to find anything on your own.**

## Course work flow
- Most days you'll have something to read or watch, and you'll need to show me you did that via some type of quiz or reading reflection or other kind of short essay assignment.

- I try to provide a short overview video for each week that highlights a few "big points" that I hope you'll keep in mind as you make your way through the readings. These are important to mention in your reading reflections.

- Some days (or set of days) have their own "big points" video (these are really short!) to call attention to big picture ideas that might get lost in the details of the readings.

- I try to hold you accountable for keeping up with the readings by asking you to write short [reading reflections](reading-reflections). Some reflections have been replaced by other assignments to focus on other skills.

- Other days have a quiz on the readings or video. I try to make the quizzes impossible if you haven't done the work and easy if you have. Many questions are deliberately misleading to better evaluate your grasp of the course material. My hope is that if you just try to guess the answer, you'll get about 50%. There are almost always short answer questions on quizzes that allow you to "show what you know" and gain points that way as well.

- All assignments are DUE BY MIDNIGHT on the day they are listed on the syllabus.


## Assignments and Grading

### Reading Reflections

The little equations after the assignment type indicates `number of assignments` x `points for each` x `weight` = `total points`
- Occasional reading/lecture quizzes (~6 x ~10 x 1 = ~60)
- [Reading reflections](reading-reflections)(16 x 2 x 2 = 32)
- [Healthy diet analysis](healthy-diet-analysis) (1 x 15 = 15) Due in lieu of a weekly reflection on the last day of class.
- [Final learning reflection](final-reflections) (1 x 30 x 2 = 60) Due on the last official day of the 2H summer term. This is not a huge chunk of your grade, but this is the last chance to increase your point total for the course.


### Grade Distribution
Depending on how the course unfolds, the final number of points may ( = will almost certainly) change slightly. But the percent grading scale will remain basically the same (it can only become _easier_ to get a higher grade). 

**Note that the whole scale is a little "easier" than the "standard" grading scale.** This is because some quiz questions might be too vague or unclear or whatever, or a reading reflection gets a bit misunderstood or doesn't convey what you intend. So rather than waste time nitpicking points here and there (which some of you would do), I just give them all to everyone right away. 

Percent | Grade
--- | ---
95+ | A+
90-94 | A
88-89 | A-
85-87 | B+
82-84 | B
80-81 | B-
77-79 | C+
73-76 | C
66-72 | C-
61-65 | D+
56-60 | D
55- | F


### Extra Credit (due the last day of finals)

- If you are interested in a particular topic related to the class and want to do extra work for extra points, ask me about it! I'm quite flexible about helping people to work they are excited about that contributed to the learning objectives of the course. 
- Default assignment: [Diet/Health/Food Documentary Critique](film-analysis) (4 points)
- Be mindful that extra credit gets graded, too, so just doing something  doesn't necessarily get you many points. Email these to me directly. 
- CAREFUL! Extra credit is only available if all other work is turned in!


## AI Policy & Academic Integrity
- AI is awesome!
- You must use it in accordance with UNM's academic integrity policy
  - You cannot submit AI-generated work as your own
- You should learn to use it effectively
  - All work for the course must draw exclusively from course material (and the narrative presented here), which AI will not do. This makes it easy to spot inappropriate use of AI!

You should be familiar with [UNM’s Policy on Academic Dishonesty and the Student Code of Conduct](http://pathfinder.unm.edu/policies.htm#studentcode) which outline academic misconduct defined as plagiarism, cheating, fabrication, or facilitating any such act.


## Accessibility

As your instructor, it is my objective to facilitate an accessible education experience, in which students have full access and opportunity. If you are experiencing technical or academic barriers, or concerns related to mental or physical health,  please consult with me. You are also encouraged to contact Accessibility Resource Center at arcsrvs@unm.edu or by phone 277-3506..
