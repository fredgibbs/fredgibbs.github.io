## Course Description
If someone tells you how to be healthy or what you should or shouldn’t eat, do you believe them? Why or why not? How do dietary "experts" establish their expertise? What makes some people/arguments more convincing than others? Is any dietary advice ever truly "right"? What happens during the process of translating nutrition and diet research into everyday action? How have ideas about healthy diets and healthy bodies changed over time?

This course uses the long history of diet and health to investigate the relationship between popular understandings of health and the idea of expertise.



## Student Learning Outcomes
* 1: Describe how ideas of health are constructed both culturally and scientifically
* 2: Interpret and explain the how rhetoric of health varies across different historical periods
* 3: Outline the different ways people have established dietary expertise over time
* 4: Sharpen critical thinking about the relationship between diet, health, and expertise
* 5: Critically evaluate dietary advice as a product of cultural context


## You are welcome here
Even if you have never thought about the history of medicine or diet or health, or have never taken a history course, or even a humanities course, YOU ARE WELCOME HERE! I assume you have no prior knowledge or skills necessary for class, so we build from the ground up.

I will do everything I can do help you learn as much as you're motivated to learn, and to help you get whatever grade you're aiming for. As much as possible I've tried to make the course about everyone thinking together rather than just you learning "facts" that you can regurgitate later. If you feel the course structure isn't facilitating your own success, please let me know!

## Getting Started
This page, and the [schedule page](schedule), have all the instructions and assignments you need for the course. It is YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to know what's on the syllabus. We use Canvas to manage quizzes, assignment submissions, and the discussion board, but all basic course information is on these two webpages.

### Course Readings
We use a tool called [Zotero](http://zotero.org) to organize and provide access to all readings for the course. FIRST, to get connected, see the [getting started guide](http://fredgibbs.net/courses/guides/zotero).

Once you've completed the steps in the guide (it takes maybe 2 minutes), you can access the [course library](https://www.zotero.org/groups/642043/diet-health-expertise-unm/library). 

NOTE: ALL course readings not already online are available through Zotero. **You should never need to find anything on your own.**

#### Quick Zotero Info
- Group Library Name: `diet-health-expertise-unm` (in case you need to look it up on zotero.org)
- Group Library URL: [https://www.zotero.org/groups/642043/diet-health-expertise-unm](https://www.zotero.org/groups/642043/diet-health-expertise-unm). Remember that you can only see the group library if you have joined it.


## General Work outline
While we have no formal meetings, the class is organized around modest reading assignments almost daily. The frequency of written responses generally decreases as the semester progresses.


### Reading Reflections
I try to hold you accountable for keeping up with the readings by asking you to respond to them with short [reading reflections](reading-reflections).  In place of a few reflections there are other assignments to spice things up a bit.

All assignments are DUE BY MIDNIGHT on the day they are listed on the syllabus.


### Lecture Videos
There will be short "big points" videos to watch every so often. Sometimes these will be overviews for the week; sometimes they will be weekly reviews that comment on your reading reflections; sometimes they will go over a quiz. I try to keep them about ~10-15 minutes, but sometimes I fail when I need more time to get through essential material. I am aware that watching videos of me talking is not super (or even vaguely) interesting, so I try to provide what I think is most neeeded while be respectful of your time.

## Places to Find Stuff
- [Canvas](http://canvas.unm.edu). All assignments will be submitted and graded via Canvas.
- [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCt6_7arYzi4TcIIwo7TLURw). Links to videos will be posted on the syllabus, and you can also subscribe to or bookmark the channel for quick access.


## Required Texts
There are NO REQUIRED BOOKS OR READERS for the course; everything is accessible online. However, you will need to accept an invitation to join the course Zotero library to access many of the assigned articles and book chapters. See the Tech Tools section above for instructions and links.

TO BE CLEAR: LITERALLY EVERYTHING you need for the course is either already available online (and linked to on the syllabus), or is a PDF in our Zotero library. If you ever think you need to track something down on your own, YOU ARE MISTAKEN.


## Work Requirements and Grading
Assignments are usually worth either 2 points (weekly discussion posts), 10 points (weekly learning reflections; although sometimes these are 12 or 15), or 20 points (for larger, special assignments)

The little equations after the assignment type indicates `number of assignments` x `points for each` x `weight` = `total points`
- Occasional reading/lecture quizzes (~6x~10 = ~60)
- [Reading reflections](reading-reflections)(16x2 = 32)
- [Weekly learning reflections](weekly-reflections) (11x10 = 110) (usually in response to a particular question) Due most Fridays.
- [Healthy diet analysis](healthy-diet-analysis) (1x15 = 15) Due in lieu of a weekly reflection on the last day of class.
- [Final learning reflection](final-reflections) (1x30 = 30) Due on the last official day of the 2H summer term. This is not a huge chunk of your grade, but this is the last chance to increase your point total for the course.


### Grade Distribution
Depending on how the course unfolds, the final number of points may ( = will almost certainly) change slightly. But the percent grading scale will remain basically the same, unless it becomes easier to get a higher grade. I try to minimize grade scale changes, but sometimes they are necessary and they always work to your advantage.

Percent | Grade
--- | ---
95+ | A+
90-94 | A
88-89 | A-
85-87 | B+
82-84 | B
80-81 | B-
77-79 | C+
73-76 | C
66-72 | C-
61-65 | D+
56-60 | D
55- | F


### Extra Credit (due the last day of finals)
- [Diet/Health/Food Documentary Critique](film-analysis) (4 points)
- Other ideas? If you are interested in a particular topic related to the class and want to do extra work for extra points, ask me about it! I'm quite flexible about helping people to work they are excited about that contributed to the learning objectives of the course. 

Be mindful that extra credit gets graded, too, so just doing something  doesn't necessarily get you many points. Email these to me directly. 

CAREFUL! Extra credit is only available if all other work is turned in!
