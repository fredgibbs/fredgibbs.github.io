# HIST 410: Readings and Assignments


## Mon 6/30: Introductions, SLOs, Key Concepts
We're just getting up to speed and reading two VERY different perspectives on how we can think about the links between nutrition and health generally. You have a few short introductory assignments to complete right away. 

- Introduction to the course, syllabus, and expectations.

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Introductory stuff' text="
There are a couple things to do just to make sure we're all connected. Please do them ASAP, but make sure these are done BEFORE WEDNESDAY.

- Take the Syllabus Quiz. The point is to confirm and highlight key aspects of the course to avoid confusion later. All quizzes are accessible through UNM Learn (there is a quizzes link on the left nav bar).

- Just to make sure everyone is connected, and as an informal way of introducing ourselves, please post a brief introduction to who you are and some opinion about diet and health that you've changed your mind about---we all have many! These should be substantive but not long, ~150 words or so.

## Tue 7/1: Understanding Nutrition
- Jessica J. Mudry, *Measured Meals. Nutrition in America*, 1-19 (Introduction: Eating by Numbers).


## Wed 7/2: Classical Diet
Today we cover medical and dietary thinking from ancient Greece and Rome through about 1700. Some of the medical thinking seems a bit bizarre to our modern sensibilities, but in terms of dietary advice, there is a remarkable consistency over the last 2000 years. (SLO focus: 2,4,5)

- Classical medicine, diet, and [Intro to Galen Lecture](https://youtu.be/9evKPqKOvUY)
- Mark Grant, _Galen: On Food and Diet_, 1-8. These few pages provide a general introduction to the classical physician Galen (died circa 215 CE) and ancient medicine. The author of the introduction has translated many of Galen's writing about food, and we'll read an excerpt from those as noted below.
- Galen, (tr. Mark Grant), _On the Humors_, 14-18; _On the Power of Foods_, 68-84. Note that there is WAY MORE DETAIL about foods in here than you need to know. **Read for the big picture** in terms of how Galen establishes his expertise, what topics are most interesting to him, how he thinks about the relationship between diet and health. 
  - What can you learn about medical practice in the ancient world from Galen's writing? 
  - What can you learn about how different foodstuffs differ from each other?

{% include alert.html class='warning' title='Reading reflection' text="
- How did physicians like Galen conceive the notion of disease? 
- According to Galen, how does diet fit into medical understandings of disease? 
- How is his approach similar and different to modern approaches to diet? - How do we make sense of Galen's writing style? 
- Be sure to use both the readings and the video lecture.

## Thu 7/3: Premodern diet

- [Visualizing Medieval Medicine Lecture](https://youtu.be/Jre-MOGaGmw) (posted on the YouTube channel)
- Ken Albala, _Eating Right in the Renaissance_, 63--77; 78--84; 91--104.

## Fri: July 4 Holiday


# Week 2: 18th and 19th centuries (1700-1900)

## Mon 7/7: Dietary Expertise in the Enlightenment I
The theme for next few days is how physicians beginning the 1700s started promoting dietary advice and their expertise in different ways than they did previously. We also see the early ties between dietary advice, moral authority, a common sense, a constellation of ideas we'll come back to repeatedly in very different historical contexts. (SLO focus: 1)

- Steven Shapin, "Trusting George Cheyne," 263--79. We're reading the whole article, but it's so long we're breaking up into two sections.

Questions to keep in mind while reading: 
- Why is "micromechanism" important in this article and for 18th-century physicians? 
- How did was it invoked in medical practice? 
- Are there any modern analogs to the micromechanistic approach?



## Tue 7/8: Dietary Expertise in the Enlightenment II
- Steven Shapin, "Trusting George Cheyne," 279--97.

Questions to keep in mind while reading: 
- What kinds of advice did his patients get in their personal correspondence? 
- Was there any conflict with common sense? How did Cheyne appeal to morality in his letters with patients?

## Wed 7/9: Cheyne himself
{% include alert.html class='info' title='A note on primary sources' text="
After taking even a single upper-level history course, you should have a sense of what historians actually do. Today tries to show that working with historical sources is difficult! Like in any profession, good historians make the stories seem like they naturally emerge from historical sources. But when you go back at look at the original material---as we're doing today---you immediately understand how much work and INTERPRETATION goes into even the most straightforward history. Nothing at all is truly obvious. **There are no stories waiting to be told.**
"%}

- George Cheyne, [_An Essay on Regimen_](https://www.google.com/books/edition/_/ezswAAAAYAAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1)," i-xxiv, and randomly sample the whole text to get a feel for the tone, language, and rhetorical effect. Note that a single "s" within a word looks like an "f". For instance, on title page you'll see "Philofophical" instead of "Philosophical". Yes, the long "f"s and the language in general seems weird to us moderns, but you get used to it after a few pages.


{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Reading reflection' text="
- How does Cheyne's advice echo what we've been reading about up to this point?
- What is different? 
- How did Cheyne establish his medical reputation? 
- Aside from the language, how different or similar is Cheyne's way of establishing expertise compared to modern dietary experts?
"%}


## Thu 7/10: Natural and Moral Diets of the 1800s
The dietary advice we just read was directed primarily toward the upper classes. By the early 1800s, however, dietary advice was increasingly directed at the emerging middle class. Physicians and moral reformers saw diets changing as a result of industrialization and urbanization as a distinct societal ill. 

Over the next few days we look at how moral and dietary advice became even more tightly coupled throughout the 1800s. Later in the course, we'll see how that link has persisted into the present day. (SLO focus: 2,3,4)

I've uploaded [a short video](https://youtu.be/gvCk9jhLie8) that highlights a few passages from four early nineteenth-century texts. Hopefully this gives you a sense of and ideas circulating about natural diet right before Graham becomes well known.

- William Buchan, [_Domestic Medicine_](https://books.google.com/books?id=Z7VbAAAAcAAJ) (1812).
- John Frank Newton, _[The Return to Nature](https://books.google.com/books?id=8dwhAQAAMAAJ): Or, A Defence of the Vegetable Regimen; with Some Account of an Experiment Made during the Last Three or Four Years in the Author’s Family_ (1811)
- John Ayrton Paris, _[A Treatise on Diet](https://books.google.com/books?id=xylFAAAAcAAJ) with a View to Establish ...: A System of Rules for the Prevention and Cure of Diseases Incident to a Disordered State of the Digestive Functions_ (1829).
- Charles Turner Thackrah, _[Lectures on Digestion and Diet](https://books.google.com/books?id=t9cGAAAAQAAJ)_ (1824).



## Fri 7/11: Early vegetarianism
There is a [broader themes review](https://youtu.be/C6AOzfoU_sw) video and a [week 4 background and preview](https://youtu.be/TtGezq2yDBA) video. 

- Adam D. Shprintzen, _The Vegetarian Crusade_, Chapter 1: Proto-vegetarianism, 10-27; 32-38. This chapter briefly describes some early religious sentiments supporting vegetarianism, but most importantly (and the main reason we're reading it), it introduces Sylvester Graham and his historical context.

Questions to keep in mind while reading: 
- How did Graham establish his authority as a dietary reformer? 
- How was cholera related to his success and thinking about diet? 
- How was Graham's argument for a meat-free diet different from the Bible Christians discussed early in the chapter?


- Sylvester Graham, [A Defence of the Graham System of Living: Or, Remarks on Diet and Regimen. Dedicated to the Rising Generation](https://books.google.com/books?id=ODRlD83ww9IC), 7--15; 88--89; 95--104.
- Sylvester Graham, [Lectures on the Science of Human Life](https://books.google.com/books?id=uBUDAAAAQAAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false), preface (i-vii), and skim Table of Contents that follows. What topics stand out to you? What were you expecting to see? How is it different from what you expected?

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Reading reflection' text="
- Compare and contrast Graham's advice for healthy living with that of Cheyne.
- How is the rhetoric similar to and different from what we've seen in the course so far? 
- How is it similar to and different from our own rhetoric about a healthy diet? 
"%}



# Week 3: Scientific and Quantified Eating
There has been no bigger shift in dietary advice than starting to understand health in terms of numbers, averages, and scales. This week examines some of the earliest developments in quantification of dietary knowledge and advice. We confront the implications of this paradigm shift each day as we see nutritional information labels, and watch-like computers that count our steps each day. (SLO focus: 1,2,3)


## Mon 7/14: Quantifying diets
- Jessica Mudry, “Quantifying an American Eater” _Food, Culture & Society_ 9.1 (2006): 49--67.

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Reading Reflection' text='
On p.64 Mudry concludes that "after the development of the science of nutrition, moral terms like “good” and “bad” became enumerated and objectified in discussions of food.'

What does this mean? Do you agree? How much are you convinced by her argument and evidence? The most important aspect of your reply is the ARGUMENT and EVIDENCE that YOU PROVIDE.
"%}




## Tue 7/15: Diet and Morality
- Charlotte Biltekoff, *Eating Right in America*, Chapter 2: Scientific Moralization, 13--44.

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Reading Reflection' text="
Today we get another look at food reformers in the early 20th century, particularly Ellen Richards, with an emphasis on the links between diet and morality. Describe the link between home economics, nutrition, and immigration. How and why did these come to intersect as according to Biltekoff (and Mudry)?

"%}



## Wed 7/16: The Birth of the Calorie

{% include alert.html class='alert' title='Another Primary Source' text="
Our goal with this text is to understand the tone of this work that was so often referenced in our readings this week. *Skim but don't totally skip* the science details. Think about:
  - How does article reflect larger scientific currents?
  - What’s the point of all the science detail?
  - How/why does metaphor play such a prominent role in his explanations?
"%}

- Wilbur O. Atwater, “The Chemistry of Food and Nutrition: The Composition of Our Bodies and Our Food,” *Century Illustrated Magazine*, 34 (May 1887): 59--74.


{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Reading Reflection' text="
- How does Atwater establish his credibility, authority, and expertise? Be specific! 
- How was his approach different from Cheyne and Graham? 
- How much do you agree with Mudry's and Biltekoff's interpretations of Atwater after reading his work for yourself?
"%}


## Thu — Fri (7/17 - 7/18): Early 20th century sources
These two days we focus on a few diet books written between 1918 and 1922. They are all COMPLETELY different in their approach, style, and the way their authors try to establish their expertise. 

Our goal is to understand how the same cultural context could yield such different texts and how they collectively illustrate several important facets of the history of diet/health/nutrition around the time they were written. 

If you haven't seen them, check out the [Week 5 REview lecture](https://youtu.be/YrfECboBHpw)  and the [Week 6 PREview lecture](https://youtu.be/J29KZxNn3eA). (SLO focus: 4,5)

For each text, I've indicated specific pages you should read fairly carefully. IN ADDITION, carefully examine the table of contents and randomly sample pages or small sections throughout the book to get a feel for the text as a whole---like what is and what isn't addressed in the text. 


- Lulu Hunt Peters,  [Diet and Health: With Key to the Calories](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Diet_and_Health/f7UXAAAAYAAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1) (1918). Read the first 3.5 chapters, pp. 11--39 (these are tiny pages and the writing is rather breezy compared to what we're used to).

- John Harvey Kellogg, [_The New Dietetics, what to Eat and how: A Guide to Scientific Feeding in Health and Disease_](https://www.google.com/books/edition/_/CBGxvXF332cC?hl=en&gbpv=1&pg=PA1) (1921). Read the Preface (pp. 5--7); skim the Table of Contents (pp. 8--21); read pp. 25--37.

- Elmer McCollum, [The Newer Knowledge of Nutrition](https://www.google.com/books/edition/_/jndUnd5xX5wC?hl=en&gbpv=1) (1922). Read the preface (xii--ix), skim the Table of Contents, and read 1--13.


{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Compartive Reflection' text="
Consider how these texts fit into the course narrative so far.
- Think about how it addresses (or doesn't) the major themes we've focused on:
  - continuities and discontinuities of dietary advice
  - ways the author establishes expertise
  - moral aspects of dietary choice
  - differing rhetorical styles
- What are the major beliefs about diet/health/society/etc that are motivating the author to write this?
- Who is the audience? What does the author think their intended audience knows or doesn’t know?
- How are the answers to these questions maybe a bit different than they have been with earlier sources?
"%}



# Week 4: The fat and malnourished body
Fat gets a bad rap. Why is this? We've looked at the morality of dietary advice in several ways already, and one aspect that has persisted is the idea that a large body represents a moral deficiency. This week examines how the idea of fat and fat bodies became something to avoid during the early 20th century and how the legacy of vitamins and micronutrients came to define "proper" nourishment and bodily. Check out the [PREview video](https://youtu.be/O2knZDgyN5Q) (SLO focus: 3,4,5)


## Mon 7/21
- Helen Zoe Veit, *Modern Food, Moral Food*, Chapter 7: The Triumph of the Will: The Progressive Body and the Thin Ideal, 157--80.

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Reading Reflections' text="
For this exercise, bullet points are 1-2 complete sentences that clearly express a complete idea, not cryptic phrases that no one but you can understand.

- Write 5 bullet points that summarize what you think are the main points of the article. They might not be equally important; you might think your first one or two points are REALLY important and the others are less so. But I want you to come up with 5 points to highlight.
- Write 5 bullet points that point out similarities and differences to other readings we've had in the course to this point. What kinds of things have we seen before? What are variations on a theme? What's really new?
"%}


## Tue 7/22
A. F. La Berge, “How the Ideology of Low Fat Conquered America,” _Journal of the History of Medicine and Allied Sciences_ 63.2 (2007): 139–77.  If you're interested in the popular discourse of low-fat diets (mostly 1970+, but with some earlier history, too), it's got a lot of great information and shows how popular diet advice columns (like Jane Brody's in the _New York Times_) become sources in which both outdated and cutting-edge nutritional research mingle together.


## Wed 7/23
- David Berreby, [The Obesity Era](https://aeon.co/essays/blaming-individuals-for-obesity-may-be-altogether-wrong), *Aeon* (June 2013).

Here are some [BIG POINTS](https://youtu.be/joTMK0Gy7x4) to take away. (SLO focus: 1,3,4)

## Thu 7/24
Dietary villains day or two
gluten, lectins, fodmops, 


## Fri 7/25
Not many people haven't been on some kind of diet. How can we really evaluate whether any diet could be useful? Is there a "right" diet that we just haven't found? Have we known it all along? 

This chapter is about EVALUATING dietary advice and dietary CRITIQUE. As you know from the course SLOs, the course is all about learning to think critically about dietary advice, using history to gain a broad perspective on it. So now we turn our attention from evaluating the rhetoric of dietary advice to evaluating the rhetoric of dietary critique. Don't forget about the [BIG POINTS critique](https://youtu.be/Ewn7u87K9ts) for this week. (SLO focus: 1,4,5) Don't forget about the [BIG POINTS](https://youtu.be/ZEDx1Pd4lAY) for this week.
