# HIST 410: Readings and Assignments


## [Week 1: Introductions + Key Concepts](weeks/1)
This week we're just getting up to speed and reading two VERY different perspectives on how we can think about the links between nutrition and health generally. You have a few short introductory assignments to complete before Wednesday (ideally on Monday), and we jump into our more or less regular routine starting on Wednesday.


## [Week 2:  The Long History of Dietary Advice](weeks/2)
This week we cover medical and dietary thinking from ancient Greece and Rome through about 1700. Some of the medical thinking seems a bit bizarre to our modern sensibilities, but in terms of dietary advice, there is a remarkable consistency over the last 2000 years. So it's worth looking at the foundational thinking that has directly influenced modern nutrition, even if if certain aspects have been dramatically altered by increasingly sophisticated biochemical research.


## [Week 3:  Dietary Expertise in the Enlightenment](weeks/3)
Our 2-part reading for this week continues and focuses our previous attention to medical expertise and moral authority. It's very clearly written, but quite dense, so it's spread across two days so we can unpack it. The theme for the week is how physicians beginning the 1700s started promoting dietary advice and their expertise in different ways than they did previously (see Week 2). We also see the early ties between dietary advice, moral authority, a common sense, a group we'll come back to repeatedly over the semester.


## [Week 4: Natural and Moral Diets of the 1800s](weeks/4)
The dietary advice we saw directly primarily toward the upper classes in the previous week moves into the emerging middle class in the early 19th century. In particular, physicians and moral reformers see diets changing as a result of industrialization and urbanization as a distinct societal ill. We look at how moral and dietary advice become even more tightly coupled throughout the 1800s. Later in the course, we'll see how that link has persisted into the present day.


## [Week 5: Scientific and Quantified Eating](weeks/5)
There has been no bigger shift in dietary advice than a shift to understanding health and what we eat in terms of numbers, averages, and scales. This week examines some of the earliest developments in quantification of dietary knowledge and advice. Of course we confront the implications of this paradigm shift each day as we see nutritional information labels, scales, and watch-like devices that count our number of steps each day.


## [Week 6: Early Dietary Advice + Expertise comparison](weeks/6)
This is a week of primary sources---dietary advice texts written between 1918 and 1922. They are all COMPLETELY different in their tone, approach, rhetoric, and the way their authors try to establish their expertise. Our goal is to understand how the same cultural context could yield such different texts and how they collectively illustrate several important facets of the history of diet/health/nutrition. If you haven't seen them, check out the [Week 5 REview lecture](https://youtu.be/YrfECboBHpw)  and the [Week 6 PREview lecture](https://youtu.be/J29KZxNn3eA).


## [Week 7: Vitamins](weeks/7)
You've probably heard that you should take your vitamins. Of course they are crucial for health in minuscule amounts, but are we really in danger of falling short? Why is there so much focus on them? We've already seen them discussed in McCollum, but this week we look more closely at the discovery and marketing of vitamins in the early 1900s. The way the mere idea of vitamins reshaped nutritional thinking is still with us today. These readings also help us think about the relationship between scientific expertise and common sense. Be sure to check out the [Vitamin PREview video](https://youtu.be/Y4wyg8ETtbA); it might help with the quiz as well.



## [Week 8: The fat and malnourished body](weeks/8)
Is fat bad? Of course not! But to say its role within dietary advice is controversial would be a huge understatement. Why is this? We've looked at the morality of dietary advice in several ways already, and one aspect that has persisted is the idea that some people can be "too fat" (and we even have quantified thresholds, which can be highly biased as we've read about), representing some kind of moral deficiency. This week examines how the idea of fat and fat bodies became something to avoid during the early 20th century and how the legacy of vitamins and micronutrients came to define "proper" nourishment. Check out the [PREview video](https://youtu.be/O2knZDgyN5Q)


## Week 9: BREAK!
This week is a flex week to get caught up. I usually plan on a catch-up week when we have scheduled classroom meetings because I almost never quite get through everything I mean to. Obviously timing is a bit different when everything is asynchronously online. So, NOTHING TO DO THIS WEEK! Enjoy the time away from the history of dietary advice and I hope you'll be recharged for the last section of class. Our readings shift from primarily historical studies to analyses of contemporary issues---and we'll see what the long history of diet and health can add to the conversation.


## [Week 10: Obesity science, politics, and ethics](weeks/10)
Continuing with our obsession with calories and fat, this week we evaluate some pieces on the so-called obesity epidemic in America. This week is less about historical constructions of diet as we've been focused on; instead we're looking at contemporary rhetoric of diet and health in terms of obesity. These articles are a bit dated, but they still perfectly exemplify the kind of dietary philosophies and speculation that we see everyday. Our job is to critically evaluate these in terms of how we've learned to think about diet, health, and expertise in light of their histories.



## [Week 11: Chronic effects](weeks/11)
Our investigations into the history of diet have been about what we are deliberately putting into our bodies. But what about stuff we're putting into our bodies unknowingly? How can science study minute affects of certain chemicals in our bodies over long periods of time given the complexity and variety of everyone's diets? Also note some [BIG POINTS from last week LECTURE](https://youtu.be/joTMK0Gy7x4).



## Week 12: Secret Ingredients, Relative Risk, and Regulation
We assume our food is safe. We assume that corporations that sell us food or nutritional supplements aren't adulterating it, that the labels are accurate, and that claims about health benefits aren't entirely fictitious. History shows that these are not good assumptions. This week we focus a little less on health per se and more about health claims, regulation, and safety---obviously continuing our line of inquiry from last week. Also note some [BIG POINTS from last week LECTURE](https://youtu.be/BWK4JivRD-4).

Because I suspect there will be some distraction with the election (especially the aftermath), we have a slightly lighter week this week with nothing due before Friday---but you'll want to have gotten the two readings done before then you so you can write your Friday reflection.

One of the main takeaways from the readings (which can get a bit lost in the regulatory history) is that the responsibility of knowing if a given supplement or food additive is safe, or that a product has the nutritional benefit that a label or package might claim, has largely been placed almost entirely on the consumer. If you've learned anything in this class, you've probably picked up on the near impossibility of that actually happening given the conflicting science, rhetoric, values in dietary advice.

{% include alert.html class='warning' title='Nothing due before Friday' text="
No daily readings or assignments, but make sure your weekly reflection clearly engages with the two readings this week!
"%}

Questions to keep in mind with the readings---questions you'll want to consider before crafting your Friday reflection (and for other stuff like the final as well):
- What kinds of arguments has industry made to influence federal regulation/oversight?
- How is science used to determine safety?
- Why do we need food dyes anyway? Why is there so much non-food in our food?
- If the FDA is concerned about immediate safety (avoiding acute poisoning), and the FTC is concerned about commerce (enabling consumers to buy what they'd like and enable a robust economy), who is looking out for our long-term health?
- We consider some dietary advice (moderation!) more like common sense than expert advice. Is it common sense how deceptive labels can be? Sure, everyone recognizes the power of marketing and advertising---but are they influential anyway? Should that affect labeling regulation?



### Read before Friday
- Marion Nestle, _Food Politics: How the Food Industry Influences Nutrition and Health_, Chapter 10: "Science Versus Supplements", 219--235; skim 236--244; 245--246. What specifically about the regulatory process of supplements might give you pause about their safety or efficacy?

- Wendee Nicole, "Secret Ingredients", _Environmental Health Perspectives_ 121.6 (2013): A126--A133. This article is about food additives and the sketchy regulations (and the uses of science) that govern them and their safety. There's a quote in the article: "Whether a food ingredient is GRAS (generally recognized as safe) depends on the general recognition of safety, not on safety per se". What does that really mean? How is that true? What are the implications of GRAS for food safety and regulation?


### Stuff to skim through
- United States Congress. [House Select Committee To Investigate the Use of Chemicals in Food Products](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015077053083&view=1up&seq=448). _Chemicals In Food Products_. U.S. Govt. Print. Off., 195152, 1472--1478. This record of proceedings shows how nuanced arguments about the use of chemicals can be. After reading Nestle and Nicole, who make it seem obvious how government and industry can be at odds, you can see for yourself how NOT OBVIOUS it really is.
- NPR, _All Things Considered_ (host Ari Shapiro talks with author Deborah Blum), [How A 19th Century Chemist Took On The Food Industry With A Grisly Experiment](https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2018/10/08/654066794/how-a-19th-century-chemist-took-on-the-food-industry-with-a-grisly-experiment) (October 8, 2018). This is more for fun and to see how serious debates about government's role in regulation (and need for it) goes all the way back to the early 1900s.


### Fri 11/6
{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Another rhetorical analysis' text="
You won't be surprised that industry lobbying has created looser governmental regulations that people might want or assume are in place for our health. So make sure you go beyond that fact in your analysis to look more carefully at HOW (historically) that has come to pass.

From the _Council of Responsible Nutrition_ (an entity that isn't as neutral as it sounds; it's a prominent lobbying group for the supplement industry---but what a great name!), read [this brief comparison of Food and Dietary Supplement Regulations](https://www.crnusa.org/resources/food-and-dietary-supplement-regulations-compared).

Use BOTH THE NESTLE AND NICOLE READINGS to evaluate the language/rhetoric in the CRN document. How does the CRN portray federal regulation compared to how our class readings do? Does it seem stronger or weaker? What things show up in the readings this week, but not in this comparison? Does history itself tell us something important beyond what the regulations are right now?

BE SPECIFIC in your use of Nestle and Nicole in your analysis!

## Week 13: Dietary Dangers and Critiques
Not many people haven't been on some kind of diet. How can we really evaluate whether any diet could be useful? Is there a "right" diet that we just haven't found? Have we known it all along?

This week is about EVALUATING dietary advice and dietary CRITIQUE. As you know from the course SLOs, the course is all about learning to think critically about dietary advice, using history to gain a broad perspective on it. So now we turn our attention from evaluating the rhetoric of dietary advice to evaluating the rhetoric of dietary critique.

This week brings our last LAST DAILY READING REFLECTIONS! (and we're doing a full 3 to celebrate.) No weekly reflection, but still a daily one due on Friday, though.


### Mon 11/09
- Michael Specter, [Against the Grain](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/11/03/grain) (_New Yorker_, October 27, 2014).

- James Hamblin, [Lectins Could Become the Next Gluten](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2017/04/the-next-gluten/523686/), (_The Atlantic_ April 24, 2017).

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Reading reflection' text="
These writers are neither diet nor nutrition experts, so their \"expertise\" derives entirely from the success of their arguments and rhetoric. How are they or are they not convincing to you? Could they, or should they, use more history of diet and health to be more effective?
"%}

### Wed 11/11
- Elizabeth G. Dunn, [Meet the Startup That Thinks DNA Can Predict Your Best Diet](https://medium.com/s/futurehuman/is-the-secret-to-better-nutrition-encoded-in-our-genes-e0cfd1ad11a8) (_OneZero_, July 2018).

- Richard Sprague, [So Should I Eat Apples, or Not?](https://medium.com/neodotlife/review-of-viome-f024423a3d3a) (_NEO.LIFE_, February 2018).

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Reading reflection' text="
Does the history of diet and health tell us anything about the future of genetic diets? Can they EVER work? And if they COULD, would that entail a healthy or productive relationship to food?
"%}


### Fri 11/13
Eddie Kim, [THEIR DIET? 100 PERCENT MEAT. AND THEY SAY THEY’VE NEVER FELT HEALTHIER](https://melmagazine.com/en-us/story/their-diet-100-percent-meat-and-they-say-theyve-never-felt-healthier), (_Mel Magazine_, 2019).


{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Reading reflection, but 10 points' text="
I hope it's no surprise for me to say that one of the main goals of this course is to sharpen critical faculties when it comes to dietary advice. This article is a kind-of-fun but highly problematic read. Let's get into it! Critique the article for today: What does it do well? How does it disappoint? How does it use history effectively (if at all)? What kinds of topics issues have we covered in class (yes, the whole thing!) that it should have addressed?
"%}




## Week 14: Review and Reflection 1
This week we're really starting to ramp down for the course. As a warm up for the course final (due the last Friday of Finals Week), your weekly reflection this week will be to analyze Wednesday's reading (for which there is no assignment) in terms of the whole course.


### Mon 11/16
- Christie Aschwanden, [You Can’t Trust What You Read About Nutrition](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/you-cant-trust-what-you-read-about-nutrition/), (_FiveThirtyEight_, Jan 6, 2016).

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Reading Quiz' text="
Just a basic reading quiz for today
"%}

### Wed 11/18
- Dariush Mozaffarian, Irwin Rosenberg, Ricardo Uauy, "History of modern nutrition science—implications for current research, dietary guidelines, and food policy", (_BMJ_ 2018;361:k2392).

{% include alert.html class='warning' title='NO READING REFLECTIONS' text="
No reading responses due today, but look ahead to Friday.
"%}


### Fri 11/20
- NO NEW READING, just your weekly reflection as explained below.

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Weekly Reflection' text="
For your weekly reflection this week, we're going to do a kind of a Final Course Reflection Warm-up. Reflecting on what we've done in the course so far, how well does Wednesday's reading establish/outline a productive future for understanding the relationship between nutrition, diet, and health? What is the (implied) role of science? We've obviously covered a lot more history than is in (or may be appropriate for) for an article like this. Are there ISSUES (not necessarily specific historic \"facts\") that the article should have engaged with? The more readings you can review and try to tie in from the entire, the easier and better your final will be. 
"%}



## Week 15: Food Traditions and Societal Health
We can't NOT read about Thanksgiving this week! These readings have nothing to do with diet/health, but we might also think about how food relates to civic health in addition to bodily health. It's common to think about food as bringing people together, but it's also a way of exerting control.

You have one post due this week, which I highly recommend you complete BY WEDNESDAY NIGHT. But if you're swamped with other essays, exams, etc, just make sure to post it before the end of the weekend.

### Anytime this week
- Andrew F. Smith, “The First Thanksgiving”, _Gastronomica_ 3.4 (2003): 79–85.
- Philip Deloria, “The Invention of Thanksgiving”, _New Yorker_, 95.37 (November 25, 2019): 70–74.

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Weekly Reflection' text="
This is a more reflective/opinion post than normal, but they should still show me you're familiar with ALL the readings for this week.
- How do the Thanksgiving articles complicate the traditional Thanksgiving narrative?
- How do the articles suggest that food traditions play a role in societal health?
- Does holiday food itself really matter (like turkey, or ham), or is it just a vehicle for other social functions?
"%}

### Thurs 11/26: Thanksgiving!
Bon Appétit!




## Week 16: Review and Reflection 2
Our brains are full! Rather than more readings, let's apply the thinking and analytical approach from this class to contemporary sources, like a website about healthy diets. Your only thing to do this week is a [Healthy Diet Analysis]((healthy-diet-analysis).

We have read a lot about explicit dietary advice, but obviously a lot of what we "know" about health and diet comes not just from contemporary research, but the long history of how we have thought about diet and health. How does the HISTORY that we've covered help explain why diet advice looks like it does?


### Mon 11/30
- For day, watch the pro tips VIDEO (link TBP), which will provide a quick walk-thru example of how to do the healthy diet analysis (due Friday).  

### Wed 12/02
NO READING

### Fri 12/04
{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Healthy Diet Analysis' text="
As a preparatory exercise for the [final course reflection](final-reflections), your [healthy diet analysis](healthy-diet-analysis) is due today.
