# HIST 410: Readings and Assignments

## Mon 6/30: Introductions, SLOs, Key Concepts
Welcome! Today we're just getting up to speed with course logistics. There are a couple things to do just to make sure erverything is wired up for our month together. Please do them ASAP, but make sure these are done BEFORE WEDNESDAY. Normally stuff is due the day it appears on the syllabus, but we can take an extra day to get up to speed.

- [Course overview video](https://youtu.be/N_4Gj2mKnDA)
- [First week overview](https://youtu.be/jU_0BGbsW4Q)
- Yours truly, [A healthy dose of skepticism](https://nursingclio.org/2017/05/24/a-healthy-dose-of-skepticism/)


{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Introductory stuff to do' text="
- Take the Syllabus (and a little on the firt reading) Quiz. The point is to confirm and highlight important logistics of the course to avoid problems later. 
- We don't do a lot of discussion boarding, but we do a little today. Just to make sure everyone is connected, and as an informal way of introducing ourselves, please post a brief introduction to who you are and some opinion about diet and health that you've changed your mind about---we all have many! These should be substantive but not long, ~150 words or so.

## Tue 7/1: Understanding Nutrition
- Jessica J. Mudry, *Measured Meals. Nutrition in America*, 1-19 (Introduction: Eating by Numbers). 

This chapter discusses the quantificaiton of dietary advice and the implications of such a change, which we dive into in week 3. The reason we start with it is because she calls direct attention to "the rhetoric of science". Her point is talking about diet is never just about the "facts"---if there even is such a thing (and there isn't)---but also about **how they are discussed**. Language itself is not just a reporter of knowedlge, but a direct shaper of it. 

Her focus is on the language of quantification, but it can help us think about HOW WE TALK ABOUT HEALTH AND DIET. I want to set up this drame of analysis so we can be thinking about rhetoric of diet and health as we move through the course (even if the first few weeks don't have anything about quantification). 


{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Reading reflection' text='
- Be sure to review the [reading reflection guidelines](reading-reflections)
- What is significance of discourse / language of quantification?
- Would you agree with Her argument that the langauge of quantification to proscribe a "healthy" diet is a failure?
- In terms of dietary advice specifically, what are the pros and cons of quantification?'

## Wed 7/2: Classical Diet
Today we cover medical and dietary thinking from ancient Greece and Rome. Some of the medical thinking seems a bit bizarre to our modern sensibilities, but in terms of dietary advice, there is a remarkable consistency over the last 2000 years. 

- [Classical medicine video](https://youtu.be/OEPWJAYnO6E)
- Mark Grant, _Galen: On Food and Diet_, 1-8. These few pages provide a general introduction to the classical physician Galen (died circa 215 CE) and ancient medicine. The author of the introduction (Grant) has translated many of Galen's writing about food, and we'll read an excerpt from those as noted below.
- Galen, (tr. Mark Grant), _On the Humors_, 14-18; _On the Power of Foods_, 68-84. This was written by Galen himself (not Grant).Note that there is WAY MORE DETAIL about foods in here than you need to know. **Read for the big picture** in terms of how Galen establishes his expertise, what topics are most interesting to him, how he thinks about the relationship between diet and health. 

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Reading reflection' text="
- How did physicians like Galen conceive the notion of disease? 
- Using examples from Galen's text, show how diet fit into medical understandings of disease.
- Why would Galen think it was important to describe foods the way he did?
- How does Galen try to establish his expertise in this text? 
"%}


## Thu 7/3: Medieval Medicine Premodern diet
We explore the contours of medieval medicine, providing important context for understanding the long history of diet and health advice. While this course focuses on the 19th and 20th centuries, it's crucial to recognize that physicians have been debating what constitutes healthy food and good nutrition for a very long time. This week's lectures establish the foundation of the Western medical tradition as it pertains to diet, and helps us understand the close coupling between diet and culture.

- [Visualizing Premodern Medicine](https://youtu.be/oa-b8llXLTk)
- SKIM: Ken Albala, _Eating Right in the Renaissance_, 63--77; 78--84; 91--104.

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Lecture Quiz' text="
- Be sure to complete the quiz (see Quizzes link on left nav of Canvas), which covers BOTH the medieval medicine video and a few broad questions about the early modern diet reading that you should be able to answer by skimming.
- This quiz is due by the END OF TOMORROW, since we don't have anything new b/c of the holiday.

## Fri: July 4 Holiday


# Week 2: 18th and 19th centuries
The theme for next few days is how physicians beginning the 1700s started promoting dietary advice and their expertise in different ways than they did previously. We also see the early ties between dietary advice, moral authority, a common sense, a constellation of ideas we'll come back to repeatedly in very different historical contexts. 

- [Week 2 Overview](https://youtu.be/AabeM83A8_4)


## Mon 7/7: Dietary Expertise in the Enlightenment
- Steven Shapin, "Trusting George Cheyne," 263--97. This article is clear and informative, but way longer than it needs with too much detail. (yay academic writing!) So, let's use AI to help us sort it out. And help us learn how to use AI. Take the PDF from Zotero and upload it into some AI tool (chatGPT, for instance, but it doesn't matter which one), and ask for a summary of the article. 

You'll find it's actually not bad. But it's still REALLY reductive (meaning it misses a lot). Your job is to skim the Shapin article for yourself and compare the impression you get from the actual text (even if skimming) compared to the AI summary. 


{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Reading Reflections' text="
#### Make sure you're giving SPECIFIC examples!

- What are the key ideas about medical practice in general that the AI summary leaves out?
- When skimming for yourself, what little bits of information did you think were interesting that didn't appear in the summary?
- How would you describe the larger narrative arc of the article that inevitably gets lost in an AI summary?
- Why is _micromechanism_ important in this article and for 18th-century physicians? 
- Was Cheyne's advice in conflict with common sense as discussed in the early part of the article? 
- How did Cheyne appeal to morality in his letters with patients?
"%}



## Tue 7/8: Cheyne himself
{% include alert.html class='info' title='A note on primary sources' text="
After taking even a single upper-level history course, you should have a sense of what historians actually do. Today tries to show that working with historical sources is difficult! Like in any profession, good historians make the stories seem like they naturally emerge from historical sources. But when you go back at look at the original material---as we're doing today---you immediately understand how much work and INTERPRETATION goes into even the most straightforward history. Nothing at all is truly obvious. **There are no stories waiting to be told.**
"%}

- George Cheyne, [_An Essay on Regimen_](https://www.google.com/books/edition/_/ezswAAAAYAAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1)," i-xxiv, and randomly sample the whole text to get a feel for the tone, language, and rhetorical effect. Note that a single "s" within a word looks like an "f". For instance, on title page you'll see "Philofophical" instead of "Philosophical". Yes, the long "f"s and the language in general seems weird to us moderns, but you get used to it after a few pages.


{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Reading reflection' text="
- How does Cheyne's advice echo what we've been reading about up to this point?
- What is different? 
- How did Cheyne establish his medical reputation? 
- Aside from the language, how different or similar is Cheyne's way of establishing expertise compared to modern dietary experts?
"%}


## Wed 7/9: Natural and Moral Diets of the 1800s
The dietary advice we just read was directed primarily toward the upper classes. By the early 1800s, however, dietary advice was increasingly directed at the emerging middle class. Physicians and moral reformers saw diets changing as a result of industrialization and urbanization as a distinct societal ill. 

Over the next few days we look at how moral and dietary advice became even more tightly coupled throughout the 1800s. Later in the course, we'll see how that link has persisted through today. 

- [Primary Source Comparison Methods](https://youtu.be/MOcW6fkt6Fw)

- John Frank Newton, _[The Return to Nature](https://books.google.com/books?id=8dwhAQAAMAAJ): Or, A Defence of the Vegetable Regimen; with Some Account of an Experiment Made during the Last Three or Four Years in the Author’s Family_ (1811)
- John Tweed _[Popular Observations on Regimen and Diet](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Popular_Observations_on_Regimen_and_Diet/N47GABoEaMgC?hl=en&gbpv=1)_ (1820).
- Charles Turner Thackrah, _[Lectures on Digestion and Diet](https://books.google.com/books?id=t9cGAAAAQAAJ)_ (1824).

- William Henry Robertson, _[A popular treatise on diet and regimen](https://www.google.com/books/edition/A_popular_treatise_on_diet_and_regimen/fyKfI2pAbrUC?hl=en)_ (1835).

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Comparative reflection' text="
- Compare three texts from above in terms of similarities and differences. Guiding questions: 
  - What is the health problem the authors describe? 
  - What is their conception of disease?
  - What kinds of arguments do they use to appeal to their audience?
  - What kind of evidence to they provide?
  - What can we learn about their society and cultural context from how they discuss diet?
  - How is the text similar and different from other dietary texts we've read so far?
"%}




## Thu 7/10: Healthy Living with Crackers

- Adam D. Shprintzen, _The Vegetarian Crusade_, Chapter 1: Proto-vegetarianism, skim 10--mid 16; 16-27; 32-38. This chapter briefly describes some early religious sentiments supporting vegetarianism, and most importantly introduces Sylvester Graham and his historical context. Focus on Graham, not the Biblical Christians, but understand their general influence.

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Reading reflection' text="
- How did Graham establish his authority as a dietary reformer? 
- How was cholera related to his success and thinking about diet? 
- How was Graham's argument for a meat-free diet different from the Biblical Christians discussed early in the chapter?
"%}



## Fri 7/11: Graham himself

{% include alert.html class='info' title='Primary source' text="
Same kind of drill as with Cheyne, except a century later and a VERY different kind of diet text to consider.
"%}

- Sylvester Graham, [A Defence of the Graham System of Living: Or, Remarks on Diet and Regimen. Dedicated to the Rising Generation](https://books.google.com/books?id=ODRlD83ww9IC), 7--15; 88--89; 95--104.
- Sylvester Graham, [Lectures on the Science of Human Life](https://books.google.com/books?id=uBUDAAAAQAAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false), preface (i-vii), and skim Table of Contents that follows. What topics stand out to you? What were you expecting to see? How is it different from what you expected?

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Reading reflection' text="
- Compare and contrast Graham's advice for healthy living with that of Cheyne.
- How is the rhetoric similar to and different from what we've seen in the course so far? 
- How is it similar to and different from our own rhetoric about a healthy diet? 
"%}



# Week 3: Scientific and Quantified Eating
There has been no bigger shift in dietary advice than starting to understand health in terms of numbers, averages, and scales. This week examines some of the earliest developments in quantification of dietary knowledge and advice. We confront the implications of this paradigm shift each day as we see nutritional information labels, and watch-like computers that count our steps each day.


## Mon 7/14: Quantifying diets
- Jessica Mudry, “Quantifying an American Eater” _Food, Culture & Society_ 9.1 (2006): 49--67.

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Reading Reflection' text='
On p.64 Mudry concludes that "after the development of the science of nutrition, moral terms like “good” and “bad” became enumerated and objectified in discussions of food."

What does this mean? Do you agree? How much are you convinced by her argument and evidence? I\'m asking for your opinion here, but it should be carefully and clearly informed by the reading, and put in the context of other course readings.
'%}




## Tue 7/15: Diet and Morality
- Charlotte Biltekoff, *Eating Right in America*, Chapter 2: Scientific Moralization, 13--44.

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Reading Reflection' text="
Today we look at food reformers in the early 20th century, particularly Ellen Richards, with an emphasis on the links between diet and morality. Describe the link between home economics, nutrition, and immigration. How and why did these come to intersect as according to Biltekoff (and Mudry)?
"%}



## Wed 7/16: The Birth of the Calorie

{% include alert.html class='info' title='Another Primary Source' text="
Our goal with this text is to understand the tone of this work that was so often referenced in our readings this week. *Skim but don't totally skip* the science details. 
  - How does article reflect larger scientific currents?
  - What’s the point of all the science detail?
  - How/why does metaphor play such a prominent role in his explanations?
"%}

- Wilbur O. Atwater, “The Chemistry of Food and Nutrition: The Composition of Our Bodies and Our Food,” *Century Illustrated Magazine*, 34 (May 1887): 59--74.


{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Reading Reflection' text="
- How does Atwater establish his credibility, authority, and expertise? Be specific! 
- How was his approach different from Cheyne and Graham? 
- How much do you agree with Mudry's and Biltekoff's interpretations of Atwater after reading his work for yourself?
"%}


## Thu — Fri (7/17 - 7/18): Early 20th century sources
These two days we focus on a few diet books written between 1918 and 1922. They are all COMPLETELY different in their approach, style, and the way their authors try to establish their expertise. 

Our goal is to understand how the same cultural context could yield such different texts and how they collectively illustrate several important facets of the history of diet/health/nutrition around the time they were written. 

For each text, I've indicated specific pages you should read fairly carefully. IN ADDITION, carefully examine the table of contents and randomly sample pages or small sections throughout the book to get a feel for the text as a whole---like what is and what isn't addressed in the text. 


- Lulu Hunt Peters,  [Diet and Health: With Key to the Calories](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Diet_and_Health/f7UXAAAAYAAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1) (1918). Read the first 3.5 chapters, pp. 11--39 (these are tiny pages and the writing is rather breezy compared to what we're used to).

- John Harvey Kellogg, [_The New Dietetics, what to Eat and how: A Guide to Scientific Feeding in Health and Disease_](https://www.google.com/books/edition/_/CBGxvXF332cC?hl=en&gbpv=1&pg=PA1) (1921). Read the Preface (pp. 5--7); skim the Table of Contents (pp. 8--21); read pp. 25--37.

- Elmer McCollum, [The Newer Knowledge of Nutrition](https://www.google.com/books/edition/_/jndUnd5xX5wC?hl=en&gbpv=1) (1922). Read the preface (xii--ix), skim the Table of Contents, and read 1--13.


{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Compartive Reflection' text="
Consider how these texts fit into the course narrative so far.
- Think about how it addresses (or doesn't) the major themes we've focused on:
  - continuities and discontinuities of dietary advice
  - ways the author establishes expertise
  - moral aspects of dietary choice
  - differing rhetorical styles
- What are the major beliefs about diet/health/society/etc that are motivating the author to write this?
- Who is the audience? What does the author think their intended audience knows or doesn’t know?
- How are the answers to these questions maybe a bit different than they have been with earlier sources?
"%}



# Week 4: The fat and malnourished body
Fat gets a bad rap. Why is this? We've looked at the morality of dietary advice in several ways already, and one aspect that has persisted is the idea that a large body represents a moral deficiency. This week examines how the idea of fat and fat bodies became something to avoid during the early 20th century and how the legacy of vitamins and micronutrients came to define "proper" nourishment and bodily. 


## Mon 7/21
- Helen Zoe Veit, *Modern Food, Moral Food*, Chapter 7: The Triumph of the Will: The Progressive Body and the Thin Ideal, 157--80.

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Reading Reflections' text="
For this exercise, bullet points are 1-3 complete sentences that clearly express a complete idea, not cryptic phrases that no one but you can understand. 

- Write 4 bullet points that summarize what you think are the main points of the article. They might not be equally important; you might think your first one or two points are REALLY important and the others are less so. But I want you to come up with 5 points to highlight.
- Write 4 bullet points that point out similarities and differences to other readings we've had in the course to this point. What kinds of things have we seen before? What are variations on a theme? What's really new?
- For each of your bullet points, briefly indicate your thinking behind it. 
"%}


## Tue 7/22
A. F. La Berge, “How the Ideology of Low Fat Conquered America,” _Journal of the History of Medicine and Allied Sciences_ 63.2 (2007): 139–77.  If you're interested in the popular discourse of low-fat diets (mostly 1970+, but with some earlier history, too), it's got a lot of great information and shows how popular diet advice columns (like Jane Brody's in the _New York Times_) become sources in which both outdated and cutting-edge nutritional research mingle together.


## Wed 7/23
- David Berreby, [The Obesity Era](https://aeon.co/essays/blaming-individuals-for-obesity-may-be-altogether-wrong), *Aeon* (June 2013).

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Reading reflection' text="
Let's be clear: this article DOES NOT try to argue that personal choice is not a cause of obesity. But it does try to suggest other reasons that also matter. How does this course help explain WHY the author wrote this? According to the author, how should \"science\" be used to help understand obesity? 
"%}



## Thu 7/24
Dietary villains: gluten, lectins, fodmops


## Fri 7/25
How can we really evaluate whether any diet could be useful? Is there a "right" diet that we just haven't found? Have we known it all along? 

This chapter is about EVALUATING dietary advice and dietary CRITIQUE. As you know from its overall goals, this course is all about learning to think critically about dietary advice and expertise in general, using history to gain a broader perspective. Today we turn our attention from evaluating the rhetoric of dietary advice to evaluating the rhetoric of dietary critique. 

- Eddie Kim, [Their Diet? 100 Percent Meat. And They Say They've Never Felt Healthier](https://melmagazine.com/en-us/story/their-diet-100-percent-meat-and-they-say-theyve-never-felt-healthier), (_Mel Magazine_, 2019).


{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Reading reflection' text="
CRITIQUE (do NOT SUMMARIZE) the article for today: What does it do well? How does it disappoint? Describe how its use and effectiveness in using history. Can you tell what's missing (in general, not a specific topic)?

TO REPEAT: Don't get sidetracked by analyzing or critiquing the diet that is the subject of the article. Whether a meat-only diet is a good idea (spoiler: no!) is not the point here. CRITIQUE THE ARTICLE, NOT THE DIET.
