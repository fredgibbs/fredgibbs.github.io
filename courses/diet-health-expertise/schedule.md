# HIST 410: Readings and Assignments


## [Week 1: Introductions + Key Concepts](weeks/1)
This week we're just getting up to speed and reading two VERY different perspectives on how we can think about the links between nutrition and health generally. You have a few short introductory assignments to complete before Wednesday (ideally on Monday), and we jump into our more or less regular routine starting on Wednesday.


## [Week 2:  The Long History of Dietary Advice](weeks/2)
This week we cover medical and dietary thinking from ancient Greece and Rome through about 1700. Some of the medical thinking seems a bit bizarre to our modern sensibilities, but in terms of dietary advice, there is a remarkable consistency over the last 2000 years. So it's worth looking at the foundational thinking that has directly influenced modern nutrition, even if if certain aspects have been dramatically altered by increasingly sophisticated biochemical research.


## [Week 3:  Dietary Expertise in the Enlightenment](weeks/3)
Our 2-part reading for this week continues and focuses our previous attention to medical expertise and moral authority. It's very clearly written, but quite dense, so it's spread across two days so we can unpack it. The theme for the week is how physicians beginning the 1700s started promoting dietary advice and their expertise in different ways than they did previously (see Week 2). We also see the early ties between dietary advice, moral authority, a common sense, a group we'll come back to repeatedly over the semester.


## [Week 4: Natural and Moral Diets of the 1800s](weeks/4)
The dietary advice we saw directly primarily toward the upper classes in the previous week moves into the emerging middle class in the early 19th century. In particular, physicians and moral reformers see diets changing as a result of industrialization and urbanization as a distinct societal ill. We look at how moral and dietary advice become even more tightly coupled throughout the 1800s. Later in the course, we'll see how that link has persisted into the present day.


## [Week 5: Scientific and Quantified Eating](weeks/5)
There has been no bigger shift in dietary advice than a shift to understanding health and what we eat in terms of numbers, averages, and scales. This week examines some of the earliest developments in quantification of dietary knowledge and advice. Of course we confront the implications of this paradigm shift each day as we see nutritional information labels, scales, and watch-like devices that count our number of steps each day.


## [Week 6: Early Dietary Advice + Expertise comparison](weeks/6)
This is a week of primary sources---dietary advice texts written between 1918 and 1922. They are all COMPLETELY different in their tone, approach, rhetoric, and the way their authors try to establish their expertise. Our goal is to understand how the same cultural context could yield such different texts and how they collectively illustrate several important facets of the history of diet/health/nutrition. If you haven't seen them, check out the [Week 5 REview lecture](https://youtu.be/YrfECboBHpw)  and the [Week 6 PREview lecture](https://youtu.be/J29KZxNn3eA).


## [Week 7: Vitamins](weeks/7)
You've probably heard that you should take your vitamins. Of course they are crucial for health in minuscule amounts, but are we really in danger of falling short? Why is there so much focus on them? We've already seen them discussed in McCollum, but this week we look more closely at the discovery and marketing of vitamins in the early 1900s. The way the mere idea of vitamins reshaped nutritional thinking is still with us today. These readings also help us think about the relationship between scientific expertise and common sense. Be sure to check out the [Vitamin PREview video](https://youtu.be/Y4wyg8ETtbA); it might help with the quiz as well.



## [Week 8: The fat and malnourished body](weeks/8)
Is fat bad? Of course not! But to say its role within dietary advice is controversial would be a huge understatement. Why is this? We've looked at the morality of dietary advice in several ways already, and one aspect that has persisted is the idea that some people can be "too fat" (and we even have quantified thresholds, which can be highly biased as we've read about), representing some kind of moral deficiency. This week examines how the idea of fat and fat bodies became something to avoid during the early 20th century and how the legacy of vitamins and micronutrients came to define "proper" nourishment. Check out the [PREview video](https://youtu.be/O2knZDgyN5Q)


## Week 9: BREAK!
This week is a flex week to get caught up. I usually plan on a catch-up week when we have scheduled classroom meetings because I almost never quite get through everything I mean to. Obviously timing is a bit different when everything is asynchronously online. So, NOTHING TO DO THIS WEEK! Enjoy the time away from the history of dietary advice and I hope you'll be recharged for the last section of class. Our readings shift from primarily historical studies to analyses of contemporary issues---and we'll see what the long history of diet and health can add to the conversation.

### Nothing to do M,W,F Oct 12,14,16



## Week 10: Obesity science, politics, and ethics
Continuing with our obsession with calories and fat, this week we evaluate some pieces on the so-called obesity epidemic in America. This week is less about historical constructions of diet as we've been focused on; instead we're looking at contemporary rhetoric of diet and health in terms of obesity. These articles are a bit dated, but they still perfectly exemplify the kind of dietary philosophies and speculation that we see everyday. Our job is to critically evaluate these in terms of how we've learned to think about diet, health, and expertise in light of their histories.

#### Questions to keep in mind for each reading
- What’s the general trend or trends the authors are presenting?
- What are key examples to take that illustrate the authors’ points?
- What topics aren't addressed that should be?
- Is the narrative effective?


### Mon 10/19
- Gary Taubes and Cristin Kearns Couzens, [Big Sugar's Sweet Little Lies](https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2012/10/sugar-industry-lies-campaign/), _Mother Jones_ (Nov/Dec 2012).

This article is quite rich in detail and at times like drinking from a fire hose, so it takes some effort to not let your eyes glaze over as you read through it. Don't give up! We're reading this to practice understanding history of nutrition narratives and to evaluate the relationship between science and industry. We DO NOT need to (and absolutely should not under any circumstances) absorb all the names and events and studies the article references. Sometimes you read for specific information; sometimes you read for the argument in general. FOCUS ON THE ARGUMENT (and the evidence to support it).

Pay particular attention to how "science" is used in determining how dangerous (or not) sugar is. While the history of nutrition narrative that we've been following has generally shown how "science" is creating more knowledge about nutrition (even if it might be used for a particular social agenda), this article shows how the inherent uncertainties of "science" can be used (usually by facets of the food industry) to undermine confidence in that same nutrition research. I feel a little bad for putting "science" in quotes all the time, but I want you to think about how many different things it can mean. They are all on display in the readings for this week.


{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Reading reflection' text="
You're riding in an elevator and someone you admire gets on and notices you reading this article on your phone. They say to you: \"That looks long and boring, but I've been wondering: Is sugar actually dangerous? How would we know one way or the other?\" You've got about a minute to make a good impression and answer the questions smartly (BASED ON THE ARTICLE). What are you going to say? Needless to say, if you just babble on without showing your knowledge of the article or the history your VIP will be unimpressed and you will lament your missed opportunity forever.

_Note: This is all a fanciful way of asking you to boil down a long and dry but highly informative article to the main points that the average person should know about._

### Wed 10/21
- David H. Freedman, [How Junk Food Can End Obesity](http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2013/07/how-junk-food-can-end-obesity/309396/?single_page=true), _The Atlantic_ (August 2013).
- Tom Philpott, [Why The Atlantic’s Defense of Junk Food Fails](http://www.motherjones.com/tom-philpott/2013/06/fat-chance-why-atlantics-defense-junk-food-fails), _Mother Jones_ (August 2013).

These readings are both straightforward enough that they don't need much of an introduction. Yet I want to be clear they are BOTH deeply flawed and that's why it's fun for us to dissect them as a pair. Pay close attention to the RHETORIC of these articles---the way they are trying to persuade you.

Some (at this point in the course, hopefully familiar) questions that will help to evaluate the rhetoric:
- What assumptions about people/society/health are each making?
- How do the authors use "science" to argue their point?
- How does each NOT address issues or concerns that they should?

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Reading reflection' text="
Everyone writes on the same question today: Is Philpott's reply to Freedman effective? Does he really refute Freedman's argument? Does he characterize it accurately? Are they really talking about the same things? Does Philpott use the history of diet and health effectively (considering what you've learned in this course)?
"%}



### Fri 10/23
- David Berreby, [The Obesity Era](https://aeon.co/essays/blaming-individuals-for-obesity-may-be-altogether-wrong), *Aeon* (June 2013).

You probably noticed that this article is referenced in the Philpott article from Wednesday, so you might think it's really making the same point---but NO! The main reason I think this article is so useful in the context of this course is that no matter what you think of Wednesday's readings, this one kind of dumps them on their heads. It just gives you a new way of thinking about science, health, knowledge, the world---everything. Good writing does that. Enjoy.

Notice that the point of the article is to get us to rethink the basic thermodynamic approach to calories that has been at the heart of American thinking about the calorie since Atwater, through Peters, Davis, and so on. So not only is the author making a scientific argument, but also a cultural / historical one---in the sense of challenging a belief so deeply engrained in our culture that takes on a level of "truth" because it's been around so long. How much "science" does it take to override "history"?

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Weekly reflection' text="
Show me you've done the readings for this week by addressing the following: What are some of the main problems and challenges with studying obesity? Have we really been looking at it all wrong? How does Berreby present a different conception of fat than we've seen in previous course readings? As always, USE THE READINGS SPECIFICALLY in your post (which is going to be a larger factor in evaluations going forward; warm-ups are over!).

## Week 11: Chronic effects
Our investigations into the history of diet have been about what we are deliberately putting into our bodies. But what about stuff we're putting into our bodies unknowingly? How can science study minute affects of certain chemicals in our bodies over long periods of time given the complexity and variety of everyone's diets?


### Mon 10/26
- Ralph H. Lutts, “Chemical Fallout: Rachel Carson’s Silent Spring, Radioactive Fallout, and the Environmental Movement.” _Environmental Review_ 9.3 (1985): 211--25.
- Rachel Carson, _Silent Spring_, 5--13; 15--37.

We're reading Lutts just for a bit of background about Carson and to understand her profound significance. It's rare that one can trace or attribute a significant cultural change to a single person, but if it's even possible, the most likely case is Rachel Carson as responsible for modern environmentalism. And it's not about the environment for its own sake (also important!) but because it so dramatically affects our health.

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Reading Reflections' text="
As some of the best writing we'll read in this course, it's worth paying extra attention to how and why Carson's language and rhetoric were so effective. Copy down the top 5 sentences from Carson that resonate with you, and a provide a sentence or two to explain why they were impactful for you. Collectively, your selected passages and explanations should make it clear what about the article you find most interesting and persuasive. If you pick rather trivial sentences, I'm going to assume you just didn't read it.
"%}


### Wed 10/28
- Warren Belasco, _Appetite for Change_, Chapter 5: The Orthodox Defense: The War of the Metaphors, 111--131.

I've tried to encourage you to pay a lot of attention to RHETORIC in this course--the way(s) an author tries to persuade you of a particular point. This chapter gives us a kind of history of rhetoric in terms of the countercuisine and the industry response to it. In earlier chapters (that we're not reading), Belasco defines countercuisine as a protest against industrialized agriculture (part of the general counterculture movement emerging in the 1960s). They characterized modern (for them) food as unnatural, dangerous, and poisonous (see Rachel Carson). This chapter describes the language and metaphors that were employed to describe food, as well as their power to influence how people think about food.


{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Reading Reflections' text="
Some of you have asked for more free-form reflection prompts, so this is one of those. There's a LOT going on in this short chapter. What are the 4 or 5 most interesting ideas you came across? For each one, explain WHY you found them interesting.
"%}


### Fri 10/30
- McKay Jenkins, _Food Fight: GMOs and the Future of the America_, 1--46 (Prologue; Are GMOs Safe?).

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Weekly reflection' text="
This assignment is like the vitamin article analysis you did, except you'll google something along the lines of \"Are GMOs safe?\". USE THE JENKINS READING to analyze the strengths and weaknesses of the article you choose. As before, be smart in your choice of article to analyze. Don't pick something super intricate or something totally superficial--they make the assignment much harder. Did I mention you should use the Jenkins reading? Posts that do not use the Jenkins reading will be heavily (and gleefully) penalized.

## Week 12: Secret Ingredients and Regulation
We assume our food is safe. We assume that corporations that sell us food aren't adulterating it or defrauding us. History shows that these are not always good assumptions.

Because I suspect there will be some distration with the election and its aftermath, we have a lighter week this week with nothing due before Friday.

{% include alert.html class='warning' title='NO READING REFLECTIONS' text="
No M/W reading responses due this week! There is a basic reading quiz for Monday. There is a different kind of weekly reflection type thing due on Friday to tie everything together.
"%}

### Mon 11/2  
- Marion Nestle, _Food Politics: How the Food Industry Influences Nutrition and Health_, Chapter 10: "Science Versus Supplements", 219--246.

- United States Congress. [House Select Committee To Investigate the Use of Chemicals in Food Products](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015077053083&view=1up&seq=448). _Chemicals In Food Products_. U.S. Govt. Print. Off., 195152, 1472--1478.

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Reading Quiz' text="
Just a basic reading quiz for today to make sure we're keeping up!
"%}


### Wed 11/4
- NPR, _All Things Considered_ (host Ari Shapiro talks with author Deborah Blum), [How A 19th Century Chemist Took On The Food Industry With A Grisly Experiment](https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2018/10/08/654066794/how-a-19th-century-chemist-took-on-the-food-industry-with-a-grisly-experiment) (October 8, 2018).


### Fri 11/6
- Wendee Nicole, "Secret Ingredients", _Environmental Health Perspectives_ 121.6 (2013): A126--A133.

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='DEBATE!' text="
In this assignment, you're going to debate yourself. Use the evidence and reasoning and history in the articles to argue in 5-6 bullet points (see [week 8](weeks/8) to refresh your memory of what I'm looking for) that government should play a WEAKER (than it does now) role in regulating  ingredients in food. Then, flip positions and provide 5-6 bullet points on why government should play a STRONGER role.

MAKE SURE YOUR ARGUMENTS REFLECTS ALL THE READINGS FOR THIS WEEK! Posts that offer only opinions without reference to the course will be graded VERY LOW. As always, specific examples are a very good idea.
"%}




## Week 13: Dietary Dangers and Critiques
Not many people haven't been on some kind of diet. How can we really evaluate whether any diet could be useful? Is there a "right" diet that we just haven't found? Have we known it all along?

This week is about EVALUATING dietary advice and dietary CRITIQUE. As you know from the course SLOs, the course is all about learning to think critically about dietary advice, using history to gain a broad perspective on it. So now we turn our attention from evaluating the rhetoric of dietary advice to evaluting the rhetoric of dietary critique.

M and W are our LAST DAILY READING REFLECTIONS! There are a few more weekly ones, though, as we try to wrap up everything from the course.

### Mon 11/09
- Michael Specter, [Against the Grain](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/11/03/grain) (_New Yorker_, October 27, 2014).

- James Hamblin, [Lectins Could Become the Next Gluten](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2017/04/the-next-gluten/523686/), (_The Atlantic_ April 24, 2017).

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Reading reflection' text="
How would you compare these two critiques of relatively new diets? Is one critique more effective than the other? These writers are not dietary experts, but are they convincing to you? Which one resonated with you? WHY?
"%}

### Wed 11/11
- Elizabeth G. Dunn, [Meet the Startup That Thinks DNA Can Predict Your Best Diet](https://medium.com/s/futurehuman/is-the-secret-to-better-nutrition-encoded-in-our-genes-e0cfd1ad11a8) (_OneZero_, July 2018).

- Richard Sprague, [So Should I Eat Apples, or Not?](https://medium.com/neodotlife/review-of-viome-f024423a3d3a) (_NEO.LIFE_, February 2018).

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Reading reflection' text="
What is your opinion on genetically informed diets? Take a broad philosophical approach to answering the question. Avoid simplistic and unhelpful conclusions like 'if it works then it's fine'. Think about questions like: Can they EVER work? And if they COULD, would that entail a healthy or productive relationship to food?
"%}


### Fri 11/13
Eddie Kim, [THEIR DIET? 100 PERCENT MEAT. AND THEY SAY THEY’VE NEVER FELT HEALTHIER](https://melmagazine.com/en-us/story/their-diet-100-percent-meat-and-they-say-theyve-never-felt-healthier), (_Mel Magazine_, 2019).


{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Weekly reflection' text="
One of the main goals of this course is to sharpen critical faculties when it comes to dietary advice. So let's practice! For your post this week, critique the Eddie Kim article using the kinds of arguments you found in the other articles for this week. What does it do well? How does it disappoint? Where does it use history effectively? What kinds of issues have we covered in class that it should have used more?
"%}




## Week 14: Review and Reflection 1
This week we're really starting to ramp down for the course. As a warm up for the course final (due the last Friday of Finals Week), your weekly reflection this week will be to analyze Wednesday's reading in terms of the whole course.


### Mon 11/16
- Christie Aschwanden, [You Can’t Trust What You Read About Nutrition](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/you-cant-trust-what-you-read-about-nutrition/), (_FiveThirtyEight_, Jan 6, 2016).

### Fri 11/20
- NO NEW READING, just your weekly reflection as explained below.

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Weekly Reflection' text="
For your weekly reflection this week, we're going to do a kind of a Final Course Reflection Warm-up. Reflecting on what we've done in the course so far, how well does Wednesday's reading establish/outline a productive future for understanding the relationship between nutrition, diet, and health? Does it use history effectively? What kinds of things have we considered that don't appear in the article? The more readings you can tie in from the course now, the easier and better your final will be.
"%}



## Week 15: Food Traditions and Societal Health
We can't NOT read about Thanksgiving this week! These readings have nothing to do with diet/health, but we might also think about how food relates to civic health in addition to bodily health. It's common to think about food as bringing people together, but it's also, as we've seen, a way of exerting control and a way of keeping people apart.

You have one post due this week, which I highly recommend you complete BY WEDNEDAY NIGHT. But if you're swamped with other essays, exams, etc, just make sure to post it before the end of the weekend.

### Anytime this week
- Andrew F. Smith, “The First Thanksgiving”, _Gastronomica_ 3.4 (2003): 79–85.
- Philip Deloria, “The Invention of Thanksgiving”, _New Yorker_, 95.37 (November 25, 2019): 70–74.
- David Foster Wallace, "Consider the Lobster", _Gourmet_ (August 2004), 50--64. READ THE FOOTNOTES!
- [Michael Twitty on Culinary Justice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhxjC3XX54g)

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Weekly Reflection' text="
This is a more reflective/opinion post than normal, but they should still show me you're familiar with the readings for this week.
- What is the NATIONAL holiday of Thanksgiving really celebrating or supposed to mean?
- How much do you think food traditions play a role in societal health?
- Does the holiday food itself really matter, or is it just a vehicle for other social functions?
- Are memories and kinship intimately bonded to the particular foods we eat (and not just eating together)?
"%}

### Thurs 11/26: Thanksgiving!
Bon Appétit!




## Week 16: Review and Reflection 2
Our brains are full! Rather than more readings, let's apply the thinking and analytical approach from this class to contemporary sources, like a website about healthy diets. Your only thing to do this week is a [Healthy Diet Analysis]((healthy-diet-analysis).

We have read a lot about explicit dietary advice, but obviously a lot of what we "know" about health and diet comes not just from contemporary research, but the long history of how we have thought about diet and health. How does the HISTORY that we've covered help explain why diet advice looks like it does?


### Mon 11/30
- For day, watch the pro tips VIDEO (link TBP), which will provide a quick walk-thru example of how to do the healthy diet analysis (due Friday).  

### Wed 12/02
