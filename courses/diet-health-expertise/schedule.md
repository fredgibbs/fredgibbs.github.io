# HIST 410: Readings and Assignments


## Week 1: Introductions + Key Concepts
This week we're just getting up to speed and reading two VERY different perspectives on how we can think about the links between nutrition and health generally. You have a few short introductory assignments to complete by the

### Mon 8/17  
- Introduction to the course, syllabus, and expectations.

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Introductory stuff' text="
There are a couple things to do just to make sure we're all connected. Please do them ASAP, but make sure these are done BEFORE WEDNESDAY.

- As an informal way of introducing ourselves, please post on the class Discussion Board in UNM Learn (should be an obvious link on the left nav bar) a very brief introduction and a brief reflection on some idea about health and diet that you've totally changed your mind about for whatever reason---we all have many!

- Take the Syllabus Quiz. The point is to confirm and highlight key aspects of the course to avoid confusion later. All quizzes are accessible through UNM Learn (there is a quizzes link on the left nav bar).

### Wed 8/19  
- Gary Taubes, [Why Nutrition is So Confusing](https://search-proquest-com.libproxy.unm.edu/docview/1496257577/fulltext/61D8DF94940D48FBPQ/1?accountid=14613).

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Reading reflection' text="
No groups for this week. Everyone will post a 'standard' reading reflection (as described on the [reading reflections](reading-reflections) page), addressing the following: How much do you agree or disagree with this article? Feel free to draw personal experiences, whatever you've read about diet/nutrition, other courses, etc.
"%}



### Fri 8/21
- Jessica J. Mudry, *Measured Meals. Nutrition in America*, 1-19 (Introduction: Eating by Numbers).

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Weekly reflection' text="
Remember that Fridays are always for WEEKLY reflections, not just individual reading reflections.

How do Mundry and Taubes take very different approaches to thinking about nutrition? What are the assumptions of the authors in terms of how we create knowledge of nutrition? How much to you agree that we really don't know what a healthy diet is? How much do you agree that there are real dangers in quantification? Whose perspective/article is more convincing?
"%}




## Week 2:  The Long History of Dietary Advice


### Mon 8/24
- Classical medicine, diet, and intro to Galen Lecture (link TBP)
- Selections from Mark Grant (tr.), _Galen on Food and Diet_: 1-8; 14-18; 68-84.

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Reading reflection' text="
Still getting settled: no groups for this week. Everyone will post a regular ~200 word reading reflection to address the following:

How did physicians like Galen conceive the notion of disease? According to Galen, how does diet fit into medical understandings of disease? How is his approach similar and different to modern approaches to diet? How would you describe his writing style? Does it seem strange for a physician?
"%}


### Wed 8/26
- Visualizing Medieval and Early Modern Medicine Lecture (link TBP, but it will be on the YouTube channel)
- Lecture Quiz


### Fri 8/28
- Ken Albala, _Eating Right in the Renaissance_, 63--77; 78--84; 91--104.

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Weekly reflection' text="
How would you characterize premodern dietary thinking? What aspects of dietary advice have persisted across ancient, medieval, and early modern periods? What elements have been discarded? How is premodern dietary thinking inferior to our current model? How is it superior?
"%}



## Week 3:  Dietary Expertise in the Enlightenment

### Mon 8/31
- Steven Shapin, "Trusting George Cheyne," 263--79.

This reading continues and focuses our previous attention to medical expertise and moral authority. It's very clearly written, but quite dense, so I've provided a bit more guidance than usual on what you might be thinking about as you read.

Let's think about common sense vs. expert advice. **Was this a new tension in the 1700s?** **How much do we still have this tension regarding modern dietary concerns?** Part of the answer to this depends on what "common sense" is at a time. What was the typical layperson's medical knowledge in the 1700s? And today? NOTE in particular: _In dietetics ... medicine pitched its tent on ground already densely occupied by moral common sense._  How similar and different to modern dietary advice? What were common criticisms of 18th-century physicians? What does Shapin mean by "micromechanism" and "iatromechanical"? Where do these terms come from?

- Group 2: Connective Reflection
"%}


### Wed 9/02
- Steven Shapin, "Trusting George Cheyne," 279--97.
What kinds of advice did his patients get in their personal correspondence? To what extent were these reasonable? Was there any conflict with common sense? How different was public and private medical advice? How specifically did Cheyne appeal to morality in his letters with patients? How did his own physical condition matter? How prevalent was the "micromechanical" approach/advice we read about last time? What kinds of experience does Shapin discuss? What are the modern analogs?

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Reflections' text="
- Group 1: Comparative Reflection
- Group 2: Standard Reflection
"%}


### Fri 9/04
- George Cheyne, [_An Essay on Regimen_](https://www.google.com/books/edition/_/ezswAAAAYAAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1)," i-xxiv, and randomly sample the whole text to get a feel for the tone, language, and rhetorical effect. Note that single "s" within a word looks like an "f". For instance, on title page you'll see "Philofophical" instead of "Philosophical". Yes, the language and long "f"s seem weird to us moderns, but you get used to it after a few pages.


{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Weekly reflection' text="
How does Cheyne's advice echo what we've been reading about up to this point? What is different?   How did Cheyne establish his medical reputation? Aside from the language, how different or similar is Cheyne's way of establishing expertise compared to modern dietary experts?

## Week 4: Natural and Moral Diets of the 1800s

### Mon 9/07

This briefly describes some of the early religious sentiments supporting vegetarianism, but most importantly (and the reason we're reading it) it introduces Sylvester Graham and his historical context.

### Fri 9/11
- Sylvester Graham, [A Defence of the Graham System of Living: Or, Remarks on Diet and Regimen. Dedicated to the Rising Generation](https://books.google.com/books?id=ODRlD83ww9IC), 7--15; 88--89; 95--104.

### Wed 9/16
- Charlotte Biltekoff, *Eating Right in America*, Chapter 2: Scientific Moralization, 13--44.
Here we get another look at food reformers in the early 20th century, with an emphasis on the links between diet and morality. A few key points to consider: What does "morality" mean in this chapter? Why is it so important (per the reformers) to have the proper diet? How is the proper diet related to the supposedly universal calorie?

### Fri 9/18
- Wilbur O. Atwater, “The Chemistry of Food and Nutrition: The Composition of Our Bodies and Our Food,” *Century Illustrated Magazine*, 34 (May 1887): 59--74.
We don't need to summarize the main points of the article---they are clearly stated at the end. Our goal is to understand the overall flavor of this article that is representative of Atwater’s work so often referenced in our readings of late. *Skim but don't totally skip* the science lesson details. Think about:
  - How does article reflect larger scientific currents?
  - To what extent has this been true for our other sources?
  - What’s the point of all the science detail?
  - How/why does metaphor play such a prominent role in his explanations? Does that still happen?

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Weekly reflection' text="
How does Atwater establish his credibility, authority, and expertise? How was his approach different from Cheyne (two weeks ago)?

  - Read the preface (xii--ix), skim the Table of Contents, and read 1--13.
  - How would you characterize the contents of the book?
  - How does McCollum establish his expertise and legitimize the "new" way of studying nutrition and bodily health?
  - How does the text differ from what impression you get from Price's chapter?


{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Weekly reflection' text="
Even though they are published within a few years of each other, how do these authors differ in how they define a successful diet? How do the authors establish their expertise?

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Reflections' text="
- Group 1: Comparative Reflection. Since we're reading the same author, make your comparative reflection on other modern writers about the history of diet that we've read. How does Price compare to Muldry or Biltekoff (to name only two).

### Fri 10/02
- Rima D. Apple, "'They Need it Now': Science, Advertising and Vitamins, 1925-1940".   

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Weekly reflection' text="
Are vitamins supplements necessary? Google some variant of that question and read through a handful of sites. Analyze the kinds of arguments made. Do you notice that they fall into distinct groups?  Does this history of vitamins matter in settling the debate?
"%}



## Week 8: The fat enemy
Do you think fat is bad? Most of us would answer a qualified no at best and a resounding YES! at worst. Why is this? This week examines how the idea of fat and fat bodies became something to avoid. Given the midterm-ness of this week, we're not doing individual reading responses, just a weekly learning reflection that ties everything together.
