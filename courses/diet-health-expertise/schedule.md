# Schedule of Readings & Assignments


## Week 1: Introductions + Key Concepts

### Mon 8/17  
- Introduction to the course, syllabus, and expectations.
- Syllabus quiz

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Introductory post' text="
Just to make sure everyone is connected, and as an informal way of introducing ourselves, please post on the class Discussion Board in UNM Learn (should be an obvious link on the left nav bar) a brief introduction to who you are and some opinion about diet and health that you've changed your mind about---we all have many! These should be ~150 words or so.
"%}

### Wed 8/19  
- Gary Taubes, [Why Nutrition is So Confusing](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/09/opinion/sunday/why-nutrition-is-so-confusing.html).


### Fri 8/21
- Jessica J. Mudry, *Measured Meals. Nutrition in America*, 1-19 (Introduction: Eating by Numbers).

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Weekly reflections' text="
How would Mundry critique Taubes's article? What are the assumptions of the author in terms of how we create knowledge of nutrition? Do we really not know what a healthy diet is? Do you agree that there are real dangers in quantification?

## Week 2:  The Long History of Dietary Advice


### Mon 8/24

- Video lecture on premodern dietary thinking

- Selections from Mark Grant (tr.), _Galen on Food and Diet_: 1-8; 14-18; 68-84.

How did physicians like Galen conceive the notion of disease? According to Galen, how does diet fit into medical understandings of disease? How is his approach similar and different to modern approaches to diet? How would you describe his writing style? Does it seem strange for a physician?


### Wed 8/26
- Medieval and Early Modern dietary thinking


### Fri 8/28
- Ken Albala, _Eating Right in the Renaissance_, 63--77; 78--84; 91--104.


{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Weekly reflection' text="
How would you characterize premodern dietary thinking? What elements have persisted? What elements have been discarded? How is it inferior to our current model? How is it superior?
"%}

## Week 3:  Dietary Expertise in the Enlightenment


### Mon 8/31
- Steven Shapin, "Trusting George Cheyne," 263--79.

This reading continues and focuses our previous attention to medical expertise and moral authority.

We need to thinking about common sense vs. expert advice. **Was this a new tension in the 1700s?** **How much do we still have this tension regarding modern dietary concerns?** Part of the answer to this depends on what "common sense" is at a time. What was the typical layperson's medical knowledge in the 1700s? And today? NOTE in particular: _In dietetics ... medicine pitched its tent on ground already densely occupied by moral common sense._  What medical advice is carved on the Apollo's temple at Delphi? How similar and different to modern dietary advice? What were common criticisms of 18th-century physicians? What does Shapin mean by "micromechanism" and "iatromechanical"? Where do these terms come from?


### Wed 9/02
- Steven Shapin, "Trusting George Cheyne," 279--97.
What kinds of advice did his patients get in their personal correspondence? To what extent were these reasonable? Was there any conflict with common sense? How different was public and private medical advice? How specifically did Cheyne appeal to morality in his letters with patients? How did his own physical condition matter? How prevalent was the "micromechanical" approach/advice we read about last time? What kinds of experience does Shapin discuss? What are the modern analogs?


### Fri 9/04
- George Cheyne, _An Essay on Regimen_," i-xxiv.

Here's our first excursion into a primary source without translation (making its eccentricities even more apparent). The language seems weird at first (and it is, compared to ours) but you get used to it after a few pages. How does Cheyne's advice echo what we've been reading about? What is different? In either case, what are his primary concerns? Can anyone actually follow this kind of advice? **How did Cheyne establish his medical reputation?**

## Week 4: Natural and Moral Diets of the 1800s

### Mon 9/07
- Emerging Questions on Natural Diets


### Wed 9/09
- Adam D. Shprintzen, _The Vegetarian Crusade_, Chapter 1: Proto-vegetarianism, 10-27; 32-38. [online](https://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?vid=0&sid=88c9c3b4-4d25-4888-9fc3-504fe236d4f6%40sessionmgr103&bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZSZzY29wZT1zaXRl#db=nlebk&AN=582993) and in Zotero.
This briefly describes some of the early religious sentiments supporting vegetarianism, but most importantly it introduces Sylvester Graham and his historical context.


### Fri 9/11
- Sylvester Graham, [A Defence of the Graham System of Living: Or, Remarks on Diet and Regimen. Dedicated to the Rising Generation](https://books.google.com/books?id=ODRlD83ww9IC), 7--15; 88--89; 95--104.
- Sylvester Graham, [Lectures on the Science of Human Life](https://books.google.com/books?id=uBUDAAAAQAAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false), preface (i-vii), and skim Table of Contents that follows. What topics stand out to you? What were you expecting to see? How is it different from what you expected?

What is your impression of these important dietary texts of the early 19th century? How do they reinforce or contradict the impression of Graham that you got from what we read in Shprintzen?

### Wed 9/16
- Charlotte Biltekoff, *Eating Right in America*, Chapter 2: Scientific Moralization, 13--44.
Here we get another look at food reformers in the early 20th century, with an emphasis on the links between diet and morality. A few key points to consider: What does "morality" mean in this chapter? Why is it so important (per the reformers) to have the proper diet? How is the proper diet related to the supposedly universal calorie?   


### Fri 9/18
- Wilbur O. Atwater, “The Chemistry of Food and Nutrition: The Composition of Our Bodies and Our Food,” *Century Illustrated Magazine* 34 (May 1887): 59--74.
We don't need to summarize the main points of the article---they are clearly stated at the end. Our goal is to understand the overall flavor of this article that is representative of Atwater’s work so often referenced in our readings of late. *Skim but don't totally skip* the science lesson details.  
    - How does article reflect larger scientific currents?
    - To what extent has this been true for our other sources?
    - What’s the point of all the science detail?
    - How/why does metaphor play a role?

- NEK book I found from before?

    - How would you characterize the contents of the book?

### Final "Exam"
- Your final assignment is to write a 1200-1500 word review essay that answers the question: "What is the use of history in understanding the relationship between food, diet, and health?" There is no "right" answer, obviously. The point is to show off the ways of thinking about diet and health that you've learned in the course.
- As discussed in class over and over and over again:
  - Formulate an answer to that question and clearly state it your first paragraph.
  - Use the rest of your essay to systematically argue for your answer using the readings and discussions as support for your argument
  - You are being evaluated on the sophistication of your answer, the clarity of your argument, and your use of course readings as support.


Find an article about diet and health, and write a 600-word answer to the question: **How does the author establish expertise?** Your analysis must use and reference class sources related to expertise! For more detail, consult the [expertise analysis writing guide](http://fredgibbs.net/courses/etc/expertise-analysis).

Package Analysis! See the [Package Analysis Guide](http://fredgibbs.net/courses/etc/package-analysis), summarized below:
    - Pick a food/food-like item that makes health claims on its package. Cereal boxes, granola bars, various snack items, frozen dinners, supplements, and similar are usually good. DO NOT pick candy or soda or any product whose label doesn't have anything to do with health. Ask if you're not sure!
    - Write a 800-word analysis about how the label informs you perceptions of healthy
    - AS ALWAYS: your analysis must draw from course readings!
