# HIST 410: Readings and Assignments


## Week 1: Introductions + Key Concepts
This week we're just getting up to speed and reading two VERY different perspectives on how we can think about the links between nutrition and health generally. You have a few short introductory assignments to complete before Wednesday (ideally on Monday), and we jump into our more or less regular routine starting on Wednesday.

All assignments are DUE BY MIDNIGHT on the day they are listed on this page. Let me know if something is not clear (ideally via Slack)!


### Mon 8/17  
- Introduction to the course, syllabus, and expectations.

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Introductory stuff' text="
There are a couple things to do just to make sure we're all connected. Please do them ASAP, but make sure these are done BEFORE WEDNESDAY.

- Take the Syllabus Quiz. The point is to confirm and highlight key aspects of the course to avoid confusion later. All quizzes are accessible through UNM Learn (there is a quizzes link on the left nav bar).

- Just to make sure everyone is connected, and as an informal way of introducing ourselves, please post a brief introduction to who you are and some opinion about diet and health that you've changed your mind about---we all have many! These should be substantive but not long, ~150 words or so.
"%}



### Wed 8/19  
- Gary Taubes, [Why Nutrition is So Confusing](https://search-proquest-com.libproxy.unm.edu/docview/1496257577/fulltext/61D8DF94940D48FBPQ/1?accountid=14613).

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Reading reflection' text="
No groups for this week. Everyone will post a 'standard' reading reflection (as described on the [reading reflections](reading-reflections) page), addressing the following: How much do you agree or disagree with the Taubes article? How much much do you think knowledge of nutrition contribute individual dietary choices? Feel free to draw personal experiences, whatever you've read about diet or nutrition, other courses, etc.
"%}



### Fri 8/21
- Jessica J. Mudry, *Measured Meals. Nutrition in America*, 1-19 (Introduction: Eating by Numbers).

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Weekly reflection' text="
Remember that Fridays are always for [WEEKLY reflections](weekly-reflections), so you'll never write only about the Friday reading---you'll always discuss it in context with the rest of the week.

How do Mundry and Taubes take very different approaches to thinking about nutrition? What are the assumptions of the authors in terms of how we create knowledge of nutrition? How much to you agree that we really don't know what a healthy diet is? How much do you agree that there are real dangers in quantification? Whose perspective/article is more convincing?
"%}




## Week 2:  The Long History of Dietary Advice
This week we cover medical and dietary thinking from ancient Greece and Rome through about 1700. Some of the medical thinking seems a bit bizarre to our modern sensibilities, but in terms of dietary advice, there is a remarkable consistency over the last 2000 years. So it's worth looking at the foundational thinking that has directly influenced modern nutrition, even if if certain aspects have been dramatically altered by increasingly sophisticated biochemical research.

### Mon 8/24
- Classical medicine, diet, and [Intro to Galen Lecture](https://youtu.be/9evKPqKOvUY)
- Mark Grant, _Galen: On Food and Diet_, 1-8. These few pages provide a general introduction to the classical physician Galen (died circa 215 CE) and ancient medicine. The author of the introduction has translated many of Galen's writing about food, and we'll read a excerpt from those as noted below.
- Galen, (tr. Mark Grant), _On the Humors_, 14-18; _On the Power of Foods_, 68-84. Note that there is WAY MORE DETAIL about foods in here than you need to know. Remember we're not concerned with that level of detail. Read for the big picture in terms of how Galen establishes his expertise, what topics are most interesting to him, how he thinks about the relationship between diet and health. What can you learn about medical practice in the ancient world from Galen's writing? What can you learn about how different foodstuffs differ from each other?

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Reading reflection' text="
Still getting settled: no groups for this week. Everyone will post a regular ~200 word reading reflection to address the following:

How did physicians like Galen conceive the notion of disease? According to Galen, how does diet fit into medical understandings of disease? How is his approach similar and different to modern approaches to diet? How do we make sense of Galen's writing style?﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿ Your responses should also draw on both the readings and ﻿﻿﻿﻿the video lecture.
"%}


### Wed 8/26
- [Visualizing Medieval Medicine Lecture](https://youtu.be/Jre-MOGaGmw) (posted on the YouTube channel)
- Lecture Quiz (see Quizzes link on left nav of UNM Learn)


### Fri 8/28
- Ken Albala, _Eating Right in the Renaissance_, 63--77; 78--84; 91--104.

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Weekly reflection' text="
How would you characterize premodern dietary thinking? What aspects of dietary advice have persisted across the ancient, medieval, and early modern periods? What elements have been discarded? How is premodern dietary thinking inferior to our current model? It what ways might it be superior?
"%}



## Week 3:  Dietary Expertise in the Enlightenment
Our 2-part reading for this week continues and focuses our previous attention to medical expertise and moral authority. It's very clearly written, but quite dense, so it's spread across two days so we can unpack it.

The theme for the week is how physicians beginning the 1700s started promoting dietary advice and their expertise in different ways than they did previously (see Week 2). We also see the early ties between dietary advice, moral authority, a common sense, a group we'll come back to repeatedly over the semester.


### Mon 8/31
- Steven Shapin, "Trusting George Cheyne," 263--79.

Questions to keep in mind while reading: Why is "micromechanism" important in this article and for 18th-century physicians? How did was it invoked in medical practice? Are there any modern analogs to the micromechanistic approach?

"%}


### Wed 9/02
- Steven Shapin, "Trusting George Cheyne," 279--97.

Questions to keep in mind while reading: What kinds of advice did his patients get in their personal correspondence? Was there any conflict with common sense? How did Cheyne appeal to morality in his letters with patients?

- Group 4: [Prompt Reflection](reading-reflections#prompt-reflection)
"%}


### Fri 9/04
- George Cheyne, [_An Essay on Regimen_](https://www.google.com/books/edition/_/ezswAAAAYAAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1)," i-xxiv, and randomly sample the whole text to get a feel for the tone, language, and rhetorical effect. Note that a single "s" within a word looks like an "f". For instance, on title page you'll see "Philofophical" instead of "Philosophical". Yes, the long "f"s and the language in general seems weird to us moderns, but you get used to it after a few pages.

A NOTE ON PRIMARY SOURCES: After taking an upper-level history course, you should end up with a sense of what historians actually do. You'll see that working with historical sources is difficult! Like in any profession, good historians make it seem easy. The stories, the narratives, the summary, etc—--it all seem so obvious! But when you go back at look at the source material, you can understand how much work and INTERPRETATION goes into those. Nothing at all is truly obvious.



{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Weekly reflection' text="
How does Cheyne's advice (from Friday's reading) echo what we've been reading about up to this point? What is different? How did Cheyne establish his medical reputation? Aside from the language, how different or similar is Cheyne's way of establishing expertise compared to modern dietary experts?

Remember that about 1/2 your weekly reflection should answer these questions, and about 1/2 should describe your own experience with the readings and assignments for the week. See the [Weekly Reflections Guide](weekly-reflections) for more details.
"%}



## Week 4: Natural and Moral Diets of the 1800s
The dietary advice we saw directly primarily toward the upper classes in the previous week moves into the emerging middle class in the early 19th century. In particular, physicians and moral reformers see diets changing as a result of industrialization and urbanization as a distinct societal ill. We look at how moral and dietary advice become even more tightly coupled throughout the 1800s. Later in the course, we'll see how that link has persisted into the present day.

### Mon 9/07 (Labor Day)
{% include alert.html class='info' title='Relax' text="
Nothing due today! Enjoy your virtual BBQs!!
"%}

### Tue 9/08
- BRIEF LECTURE: Mostly a review lecture with a BRIEF intro to 19th-century diet (link TBP; also via the [course YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCt6_7arYzi4TcIIwo7TLURw))

- EXTRA CREDIT Lecture quiz (via Learn as always) due WEDNESDAY NIGHT. Like the lecture, this is mostly course review, but a little bit on diet stuff for this week. This quiz is OPTIONAL. If you don't want extra points, don't take this quiz! That doesn't mean it will be easy, but the points are EXTRA.

{% include alert.html class='warning' title='Double Trouble' text="
I ended up making two shorter videos and corresponding quizzes, to keep things a bit more compartmentalized. So there is a [broader themes review](https://youtu.be/C6AOzfoU_sw) video and a [week 4 background and preview](https://youtu.be/TtGezq2yDBA) video. The accompanying EXTRA CREDIT quizzes are self-explanatory and in Learn as always.

{% include alert.html class='info' title='Relax' text="
I've uploaded [a short video](https://youtu.be/gvCk9jhLie8) that highlight a few passages from four early nineteenth-century texts. This is just to help give you a sense of some of the texts and ideas circulating about natural diet right before Graham become well known.

William Buchan, [_Domestic Medicine_](https://books.google.com/books?id=Z7VbAAAAcAAJ) (1812).
John Frank Newton, _[The Return to Nature](https://books.google.com/books?id=8dwhAQAAMAAJ): Or, A Defence of the Vegetable Regimen; with Some Account of an Experiment Made during the Last Three or Four Years in the Author’s Family_ (1811)
John Ayrton Paris, _[A Treatise on Diet](https://books.google.com/books?id=xylFAAAAcAAJ) with a View to Establish ...: A System of Rules for the Prevention and Cure of Diseases Incident to a Disordered State of the Digestive Functions_ (1829).
Charles Turner Thackrah, _[Lectures on Digestion and Diet](https://books.google.com/books?id=t9cGAAAAQAAJ)_ (1824).

"%}



### Wed 9/09
- Adam D. Shprintzen, _The Vegetarian Crusade_, Chapter 1: Proto-vegetarianism, 10-27; 32-38. This chapter briefly describes some early religious sentiments supporting vegetarianism, but most importantly (and the main reason we're reading it), it introduces Sylvester Graham and his historical context (who we'll read on Friday).


Questions to keep in mind while reading: How did Graham establish his authority as a dietary reformer? How was cholera related to his success and thinking about diet? How was Graham's argument for a meat-free diet different from the Bible Christians discussed early in the chapter?

- Group 4: [Comparative Reflection](reading-reflections#comparative-reflection)
"%}


### Fri 9/11
- Sylvester Graham, [A Defence of the Graham System of Living: Or, Remarks on Diet and Regimen. Dedicated to the Rising Generation](https://books.google.com/books?id=ODRlD83ww9IC), 7--15; 88--89; 95--104.

What topics stand out to you? What were you expecting to see? How is it different from what you expected?

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Weekly reflection' text="
How, if at all, are dietary CONCERNS of the early 19th century---especially about natural diet---similar to and different from our own concerns about natural diets? How is the RHETORIC similar to and different from our own? (To be clear: rhetoric refers to the way someone tries to persuade you of something.)
"%}




## Week 5: Scientific and Quantified Eating
There has been no bigger shift in dietary advice than a shift to understanding health and what we eat in terms of numbers, averages, and scales. This week examines some of the earliest developments in quantification of dietary knowledge and advice. Of course we confront the implications of this paradigm shift each day as we see nutritional information labels, scales, and watch-like devices that count our number of steps each day.

### Mon 9/14
- Jessica Mudry, “Quantifying an American Eater” _Food, Culture & Society_ 9.1 (2006): 49--67.

- Group 4: [Standard Reflection](reading-reflections#standard-reflection)
"%}

### Wed 9/16
- Charlotte Biltekoff, *Eating Right in America*, Chapter 2: Scientific Moralization, 13--44.
Here we get another look at food reformers in the early 20th century, with an emphasis on the links between diet and morality. A few key points to consider: What does "morality" mean in this chapter? Why is it so important (per the reformers) to have the proper diet? How is the proper diet related to the supposedly universal calorie?

"%}


### Fri 9/18
- Wilbur O. Atwater, “The Chemistry of Food and Nutrition: The Composition of Our Bodies and Our Food,” *Century Illustrated Magazine*, 34 (May 1887): 59--74.
We don't need to summarize the main points of the article---they are clearly stated at the end. Our goal is to understand the overall flavor of this article that is representative of Atwater’s work so often referenced in our readings of late. *Skim but don't totally skip* the science lesson details. Think about:
  - How does article reflect larger scientific currents?
  - To what extent has this been true for our other sources?
  - What’s the point of all the science detail?
  - How/why does metaphor play such a prominent role in his explanations? Does that still happen?

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Weekly reflection' text="
How does Atwater establish his credibility, authority, and expertise? How was his approach different from Cheyne (two weeks ago)?
"%}





## Week 6: Early Dietary Advice + Expertise comparison
This is a week of primary sources---dietary advice texts written between 1918 and 1922. They are all COMPLETELY different in their tone, approach, rhetoric, and the way they cultivate expertise. So we'll look at how the same cultural context could yield such different texts and how they collectively tell a very different story about the history of diet/health/nutrition than any one of them alone could do.

### Mon 9/21
- Lulu Hunt Peters,  [Diet and Health: With Key to the Calories](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Diet_and_Health/f7UXAAAAYAAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1) (1918).

### Fri 9/25
- Elmer McCollum, [The Newer Knowledge of Nutrition](https://www.google.com/books/edition/_/jndUnd5xX5wC?hl=en&gbpv=1) (1922). Stuff to think about:
  - Read the preface (xii--ix), skim the Table of Contents, and read 1--13.
  - How would you characterize the contents of the book?
  - How does McCollum establish his expertise and legitimize the "new" way of studying nutrition and bodily health?
  - How does the text differ from what impression you get from Price's chapters about vitamins?


{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Weekly reflection' text="
Even though they are published within a few years of each other, how do the three authors from this week differ in how they define a successful diet? How do the authors establish their expertise?
"%}



## Week 7: Vitamins
You've probably heard that you should take your vitamins. Of course they are crucial for health in minuscule amounts, but are we really in danger of falling short? why is there so much focus on them? This week we look more closely at the discovery and marketing of vitamins in the early 1900s. The way the mere idea of vitamins reshaped nutritional thinking is still with us today. These readings also help us think about the relationship between scientific expertise and common sense.

Does this history of vitamins matter in settling the debate? What's your take on the cacophony of modern vitamania?
"%}



## Week 8: The fat enemy
Is fat bad? Of course not, but to say it's controversial within dietary advice is a huge understatement. Why is this? This week examines how the idea of fat and fat bodies became something to avoid. Given the midterm-ness of this week, we're not doing individual reading responses, just a weekly learning reflection that ties everything together.

- NO NEW READING, just your weekly reflection as explained below.

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Weekly Reflection' text="
For your weekly reflection this week, we're going to do a kind of a Final Course Reflection Warm-up (but still the usual weekly reflection length, ~600 words). Reflecting on what we've done in the course so far, how well does Wednesday's reading establishes/outlines a productive future for understanding the relationship between nutrition, diet, and health? Does it use history effectively? What kinds of things have we considered that don't appear in the article? The more readings you can tie in from the course now, the easier and better your final will be.

## Week 15: Food Traditions and Societal Health
We can't NOT read about Thanksgiving this week! These readings have nothing to do with diet/health, but it's useful to think about civic health in addition to bodily health. It's common to think about food as bringing people together, but it's also a way of keeping people apart.

### Wed 11/25 (or anytime this week)
- Andrew F. Smith, “The First Thanksgiving”, _Gastronomica_ 3.4 (2003): 79–85.
- Philip Deloria, “The Invention of Thanksgiving”, _New Yorker_, 95.37 (November 25, 2019): 70–74.
- David Foster Wallace, "Consider the Lobster", _Gourmet_ (August 2004), 50--64. READ THE FOOTNOTES!
- [Michael Twitty on Culinary Justice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhxjC3XX54g)

How much do you think food traditions play a role in societal health? What are we really celebrating? What is the national holiday supposed to mean? How will you celebrate/protest Thanksgiving this year?

### Thurs 11/26: Thanksgiving!
Think about how important (or not) food traditions are for you. Does the food itself really matter, or is it just a vehicle for other social functions? Could it be getting in the way of something more important? Or are memories and kinship intimately bonded to what we eat? Safe travels (if applicable) and enjoy the mini-break!



## Week 16: Review and Reflection 2
Winding down with one last assignment---in lieu of the weekly learning reflection, you'll do a [Food Blog Analysis]((food-blog-analysis) that gives you a chance to apply the thinking and analytical approach from this class "in the wild".


### Mon 11/30
- [Food Blog Analysis]((food-blog-analysis) pro tips video (link TBP). This will be more detail and a quick walk-thru example of how to do the food blog analysis (due Friday).  

### Wed 12/02
NO READING

### Fri 12/04
{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Food Blog Analysis' text="
As a preparatory exercise for the final, your [food blog analysis](food-blog-analysis) is due today. We have read a lot about explicit dietary advice, but obviously a lot of what we 'know' about health and diet comes from packages, ads, cookbooks, and so on. What can modern food blogs tell us about the relationship between food, health, and diet? What issues have we covered in class are present or missing?
