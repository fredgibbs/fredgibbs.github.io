# HIST 410: Readings and Assignments


## Week 1: Introductions + Key Concepts

### Mon 8/17  
- Introduction to the course, syllabus, and expectations.

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Introductory stuff' text="
There are a couple things to do just to make sure we're all connected.

- As an informal way of introducing ourselves, please post on the class Discussion Board in UNM Learn (should be an obvious link on the left nav bar) a very brief introduction and a brief story about some opinion about diet and health that you've changed your mind about---we all have many!

- Post a hello message in the Slack workspace. It can literally say nothing more than 'hello.' Feel free to say more, of course, but the point is to make sure it works.

- Take the Syllabus Quiz. The point is to confirm and highlight key aspects of the course to avoid confusion later.

### Wed 8/19  
- Gary Taubes, [Why Nutrition is So Confusing](https://search-proquest-com.libproxy.unm.edu/docview/1496257577/fulltext/61D8DF94940D48FBPQ/1?accountid=14613).


### Fri 8/21
- Jessica J. Mudry, *Measured Meals. Nutrition in America*, 1-19 (Introduction: Eating by Numbers).

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Weekly reflection' text="
How would Mundry critique Taubes's article? What are the assumptions of the authors in terms of how we create knowledge of nutrition? Do we really not know what a healthy diet is? Do you agree that there are real dangers in quantification? Whose perspective is more convincing?
"%}




## Week 2:  The Long History of Dietary Advice


### Mon 8/24
- Classical dietary thinking (link TBP)
- Selections from Mark Grant (tr.), _Galen on Food and Diet_: 1-8; 14-18; 68-84.

How did physicians like Galen conceive the notion of disease? According to Galen, how does diet fit into medical understandings of disease? How is his approach similar and different to modern approaches to diet? How would you describe his writing style? Does it seem strange for a physician?


### Wed 8/26
- Medieval and Early Modern dietary thinking (link TBP)


### Fri 8/28
- Ken Albala, _Eating Right in the Renaissance_, 63--77; 78--84; 91--104.

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Weekly reflection' text="
How would you characterize premodern dietary thinking? What elements have persisted? What elements have been discarded? How is it inferior to our current model? How is it superior?
"%}





## Week 3:  Dietary Expertise in the Enlightenment

### Mon 8/31
- Steven Shapin, "Trusting George Cheyne," 263--79.

This reading continues and focuses our previous attention to medical expertise and moral authority.

We need to thinking about common sense vs. expert advice. **Was this a new tension in the 1700s?** **How much do we still have this tension regarding modern dietary concerns?** Part of the answer to this depends on what "common sense" is at a time. What was the typical layperson's medical knowledge in the 1700s? And today? NOTE in particular: _In dietetics ... medicine pitched its tent on ground already densely occupied by moral common sense._  What medical advice is carved on the Apollo's temple at Delphi? How similar and different to modern dietary advice? What were common criticisms of 18th-century physicians? What does Shapin mean by "micromechanism" and "iatromechanical"? Where do these terms come from?


### Wed 9/02
- Steven Shapin, "Trusting George Cheyne," 279--97.
What kinds of advice did his patients get in their personal correspondence? To what extent were these reasonable? Was there any conflict with common sense? How different was public and private medical advice? How specifically did Cheyne appeal to morality in his letters with patients? How did his own physical condition matter? How prevalent was the "micromechanical" approach/advice we read about last time? What kinds of experience does Shapin discuss? What are the modern analogs?


### Fri 9/04
- George Cheyne, [_An Essay on Regimen_](https://www.google.com/books/edition/_/ezswAAAAYAAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1)," i-xxiv, and randomly sample the whole text to get a feel for the tone, language, and rhetorical effect. Note that single "s" within a word looks like an "f". For instance, on title page you'll see "Philofophical" instead of "Philosophical". Yes, the language and long "f"s seem weird to us moderns, but you get used to it after a few pages.


{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Weekly reflection' text="
How does Cheyne's advice echo what we've been reading about up to this point? What is different?   How did Cheyne establish his medical reputation? Aside from the language, how different or similar is Cheyne's way of establishing expertise compared to modern dietary experts?
"%}




## Week 4: Natural and Moral Diets of the 1800s

### Mon 9/07
- Emerging Questions on Natural Diets (link TBP)


### Wed 9/09
- Adam D. Shprintzen, _The Vegetarian Crusade_, Chapter 1: Proto-vegetarianism, 10-27; 32-38. [online](https://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?vid=0&sid=88c9c3b4-4d25-4888-9fc3-504fe236d4f6%40sessionmgr103&bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZSZzY29wZT1zaXRl#db=nlebk&AN=582993) and in Zotero. This briefly describes some of the early religious sentiments supporting vegetarianism, but most importantly (and the reason we're reading it) it introduces Sylvester Graham and his historical context.


### Fri 9/11
- Sylvester Graham, [A Defence of the Graham System of Living: Or, Remarks on Diet and Regimen. Dedicated to the Rising Generation](https://books.google.com/books?id=ODRlD83ww9IC), 7--15; 88--89; 95--104.
- Sylvester Graham, [Lectures on the Science of Human Life](https://books.google.com/books?id=uBUDAAAAQAAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false), preface (i-vii), and skim Table of Contents that follows. What topics stand out to you? What were you expecting to see? How is it different from what you expected?

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Weekly reflection' text="
How, if at all, are dietary concerns of the early 19th century---especially concerning natural diet---different from our own?
"%}





## Week 5: Scientific and Quantified Eating

### Mon 9/14

### Wed 9/16
- Charlotte Biltekoff, *Eating Right in America*, Chapter 2: Scientific Moralization, 13--44.
Here we get another look at food reformers in the early 20th century, with an emphasis on the links between diet and morality. A few key points to consider: What does "morality" mean in this chapter? Why is it so important (per the reformers) to have the proper diet? How is the proper diet related to the supposedly universal calorie?   


### Fri 9/18
- Wilbur O. Atwater, “The Chemistry of Food and Nutrition: The Composition of Our Bodies and Our Food,” *Century Illustrated Magazine*, 34 (May 1887): 59--74.
We don't need to summarize the main points of the article---they are clearly stated at the end. Our goal is to understand the overall flavor of this article that is representative of Atwater’s work so often referenced in our readings of late. *Skim but don't totally skip* the science lesson details. Think about:
  - How does article reflect larger scientific currents?
  - To what extent has this been true for our other sources?
  - What’s the point of all the science detail?
  - How/why does metaphor play such a prominent role in his explanations? Does that still happen?

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Weekly reflection' text="
How does Atwater establish his credibility, authority, and expertise? How was this different from Cheyne (two weeks ago)?
"%}





## Week 6: Early Dietary Advice + Expertise comparison

### Fri 9/25
- Elmer McCollum, [The Newer Knowledge of Nutrition](https://www.google.com/books/edition/_/jndUnd5xX5wC?hl=en&gbpv=1) (1922).
  - Read the preface (xii--ix), skim the Table of Contents, and read 1--13.
  - How would you characterize the contents of the book?
  - How does McCollum establish his expertise and legitimize the "new" way of studying nutrition and bodily health?
  - How does the text differ from what impression you get from Price's chapter?


{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Weekly reflection' text="
Even though they are published within a few years of each other, how do these authors differ in how they define a successful diet? How do the authors establish their expertise?
"%}

"%}

As a preparatory exercise for the final, your food blog analysis is due today. We have read a lot about explicit dietary advice, but obviously a lot of what we 'know' about health and diet comes from packages, ads, cookbooks, and so on. What can modern food blogs tell us about the relationship between food, health, and diet? What issues have we covered in class are present or missing?
