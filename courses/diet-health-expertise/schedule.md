# HIST 410: Readings and Assignments


## [Week 1: Introductions + Key Concepts](weeks/1)
This week we're just getting up to speed and reading two VERY different perspectives on how we can think about the links between nutrition and health generally. You have a few short introductory assignments to complete before Wednesday (ideally on Monday), and we jump into our more or less regular routine starting on Wednesday.


## [Week 2:  The Long History of Dietary Advice](weeks/2)
This week we cover medical and dietary thinking from ancient Greece and Rome through about 1700. Some of the medical thinking seems a bit bizarre to our modern sensibilities, but in terms of dietary advice, there is a remarkable consistency over the last 2000 years. So it's worth looking at the foundational thinking that has directly influenced modern nutrition, even if if certain aspects have been dramatically altered by increasingly sophisticated biochemical research.


## [Week 3:  Dietary Expertise in the Enlightenment](weeks/3)
Our 2-part reading for this week continues and focuses our previous attention to medical expertise and moral authority. It's very clearly written, but quite dense, so it's spread across two days so we can unpack it. The theme for the week is how physicians beginning the 1700s started promoting dietary advice and their expertise in different ways than they did previously (see Week 2). We also see the early ties between dietary advice, moral authority, a common sense, a group we'll come back to repeatedly over the semester.


## [Week 4: Natural and Moral Diets of the 1800s](weeks/4)
The dietary advice we saw directly primarily toward the upper classes in the previous week moves into the emerging middle class in the early 19th century. In particular, physicians and moral reformers see diets changing as a result of industrialization and urbanization as a distinct societal ill. We look at how moral and dietary advice become even more tightly coupled throughout the 1800s. Later in the course, we'll see how that link has persisted into the present day.


## [Week 5: Scientific and Quantified Eating](weeks/5)
There has been no bigger shift in dietary advice than a shift to understanding health and what we eat in terms of numbers, averages, and scales. This week examines some of the earliest developments in quantification of dietary knowledge and advice. Of course we confront the implications of this paradigm shift each day as we see nutritional information labels, scales, and watch-like devices that count our number of steps each day.


## [Week 6: Early Dietary Advice + Expertise comparison](weeks/6)
This is a week of primary sources---dietary advice texts written between 1918 and 1922. They are all COMPLETELY different in their tone, approach, rhetoric, and the way their authors try to establish their expertise. Our goal is to understand how the same cultural context could yield such different texts and how they collectively illustrate several important facets of the history of diet/health/nutrition. If you haven't seen them, check out the [Week 5 REview lecture](https://youtu.be/YrfECboBHpw)  and the [Week 6 PREview lecture](https://youtu.be/J29KZxNn3eA).


## [Week 7: Vitamins](weeks/7)
You've probably heard that you should take your vitamins. Of course they are crucial for health in minuscule amounts, but are we really in danger of falling short? Why is there so much focus on them? We've already seen them discussed in McCollum, but this week we look more closely at the discovery and marketing of vitamins in the early 1900s. The way the mere idea of vitamins reshaped nutritional thinking is still with us today. These readings also help us think about the relationship between scientific expertise and common sense. Be sure to check out the [Vitamin PREview video](https://youtu.be/Y4wyg8ETtbA); it might help with the quiz as well.



## [Week 8: The fat and malnourished body](weeks/8)
Is fat bad? Of course not! But to say its role within dietary advice is controversial would be a huge understatement. Why is this? We've looked at the morality of dietary advice in several ways already, and one aspect that has persisted is the idea that some people can be "too fat" (and we even have quantified thresholds, which can be highly biased as we've read about), representing some kind of moral deficiency. This week examines how the idea of fat and fat bodies became something to avoid during the early 20th century and how the legacy of vitamins and micronutrients came to define "proper" nourishment. Check out the [PREview video](https://youtu.be/O2knZDgyN5Q)


## Week 9: BREAK!
This week is a flex week to get caught up. I usually plan on a catch-up week when we have scheduled classroom meetings because I almost never quite get through everything I mean to. Obviously timing is a bit different when everything is asynchronously online. So, NOTHING TO DO THIS WEEK! Enjoy the time away from the history of dietary advice and I hope you'll be recharged for the last section of class. Our readings shift from primarily historical studies to analyses of contemporary issues---and we'll see what the long history of diet and health can add to the conversation.

## Week 10: Obesity science, politics, and ethics
Continuing with our obsession with calories and fat, this week we evaluate some pieces on the so-called obesity epidemic in America. This week is less about historical constructions of diet as we've been focused on; instead we're looking at contemporary rhetoric of diet and health in terms of obesity. These articles are a bit dated, but they still perfectly exemplify the kind of dietary philosophies and speculation that we see everyday. Our job will be to critically evaluate these in terms of how we've learned to think about health and diet via their history.


### Mon 10/19
- Gary Taubes and Cristin Kearns Couzens, [Big Sugar's Sweet Little Lies](https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2012/10/sugar-industry-lies-campaign/), _Mother Jones_ (Nov/Dec 2012).

This article is quite rich in detail and a little like drinking from a fire hose, so it takes some effort to not let your eyes glaze over as you read through it. Don't give up! We're reading this in part to practice understanding history of nutrition narratives, not to absorb all the names and events and studies the article references.


{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Reading reflection' text="
You're riding in an elevator and someone you admire gets on and notices you reading this article on your phone. They say to you: \"That looks long and boring, but I've been wondering: does the sugar industry really lie to people or are they just marketing a product? Is it really dangerous? How do we know one way or the other?\" You've got about a minute to make a good impression and answer the questions smartly (BASED ON THE ARTICLE). What are you going to say? Needless to say, if you just babble on without showing your knowledge of the article or the history your VIP will be unimpressed and you will lament your missed opportunity forever.

_Note: This is all a fanciful way of asking you to boil down a long and dry but highly informative article to the main points that the average person should know about._

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Reading reflection' text="
Everyone writes on the same question today: Which perspective do you find more compelling? WHY? HOW? WHY? HOW? I'm not interested in ONLY your opinion---I want to you to make an argument as to WHY and HOW one article was more effective than the other. What expertise is required to understand how to 'end' obesity?

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Weekly reflection' text="
What is the role of nutrition science and research in understanding obesity? What is the food industry's role? What is the government's role? What _should_ they be compared to what they are?
"%}





## Week 11: Chronic effects
Our investigations into the history of diet have been about what we are deliberately putting into our bodies. But what about stuff we're putting into our bodies unknowingly? How can science study minute affects of certain chemicals in our bodies over long periods of time given the complexity and variety of everyone's diets?

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Weekly reflection' text="
How was Jenkins convincing and how was he not? Does the history of nutrition hold any relevance to understanding the debate about GMOs? Should the history as explained by Carson and Belasco be a bigger part of explaining why the debate over GMOs matter?
"%}




## Week 12: Secret Ingredients and Regulation
We assume our food is safe. We assume that corporations that sell us food aren't adulterating it or defrauding us. History shows that these are not always good assumptions.

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Reading reflection' text="
Everyone writes on the same question today: How would you compare these two critiques of relatively new diets? Is one more effective than the other? WHY? What similar and different techniques do they use to communicate their skepticism to the reader? These writers are not dietary experts, but are they convincing to you?
"%}

### Wed 11/11
- Elizabeth G. Dunn, [Meet the Startup That Thinks DNA Can Predict Your Best Diet](https://medium.com/s/futurehuman/is-the-secret-to-better-nutrition-encoded-in-our-genes-e0cfd1ad11a8) (_OneZero_, July 2018).

- Richard Sprague, [So Should I Eat Apples, or Not?](https://medium.com/neodotlife/review-of-viome-f024423a3d3a) (_NEO.LIFE_, February 2018).

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Reading reflection' text="
Everyone writes on the same question today: What is your opinion on genetically informed diets? Take a broad philosophical approach to answering the question. Avoid simplistic and unhelpful conclusions like 'if it works then it's fine'. Think about questions like: Can they EVER work? And if they COULD, would that entail a health/productive relationship to food?
"%}


### Fri 11/13
Eddie Kim, [THEIR DIET? 100 PERCENT MEAT. AND THEY SAY THEY’VE NEVER FELT HEALTHIER](https://melmagazine.com/en-us/story/their-diet-100-percent-meat-and-they-say-theyve-never-felt-healthier), (_Mel Magazine_, 2019).


{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Weekly reflection' text="
One of the main goals of this course is to sharpen critical faculties when it comes to dietary advice. So let's practice! For your post this week, critique the Eddie Kim article using the kinds of arguments you found in the other articles for this week. What does it do well? How does it disappoint? Where does it use history effectively? What kinds of issues have we covered in class that it should have used more?

## Week 14: Review and Reflection 1
This week we're really starting to ramp down for the course. Your final reading responses are due on Monday (there are more weekly reflections due, however). As a warm up for the course final (due the last Friday of Finals Week), your weekly reflection this week will be to analyze Wednesday's reading in terms of the whole course.

### Fri 11/20
- NO NEW READING, just your weekly reflection as explained below.

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Weekly Reflection' text="
For your weekly reflection this week, we're going to do a kind of a Final Course Reflection Warm-up (but still the usual weekly reflection length, ~600 words). Reflecting on what we've done in the course so far, how well does Wednesday's reading establishes/outlines a productive future for understanding the relationship between nutrition, diet, and health? Does it use history effectively? What kinds of things have we considered that don't appear in the article? The more readings you can tie in from the course now, the easier and better your final will be.

## Week 15: Food Traditions and Societal Health
We can't NOT read about Thanksgiving this week! These readings have nothing to do with diet/health, but it's useful to think about civic health in addition to bodily health. It's common to think about food as bringing people together, but it's also a way of keeping people apart.

### Anytime this week
- Andrew F. Smith, “The First Thanksgiving”, _Gastronomica_ 3.4 (2003): 79–85.
- Philip Deloria, “The Invention of Thanksgiving”, _New Yorker_, 95.37 (November 25, 2019): 70–74.
- David Foster Wallace, "Consider the Lobster", _Gourmet_ (August 2004), 50--64. READ THE FOOTNOTES!
- [Michael Twitty on Culinary Justice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhxjC3XX54g)

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Weekly Reflection' text="
This is a more reflective/opinion post than normal, but they should still show me you're familiar with the readings for this week.
- What is the NATIONAL holiday of Thanksgiving really celebrating or supposed to mean?
- How much do you think food traditions play a role in societal health?
- Does the holiday food itself really matter, or is it just a vehicle for other social functions?
- Are memories and kinship intimately bonded to the particular foods we eat (and not just eating together)?
"%}

### Thurs 11/26: Thanksgiving!
Bon Appétit!



## Week 16: Review and Reflection 2
Winding down with one last assignment---in lieu of the weekly learning reflection, you'll do a [Food Blog Analysis]((food-blog-analysis) that gives you a chance to apply the thinking and analytical approach from this class "in the wild".


### Mon 11/30
- [Food Blog Analysis]((food-blog-analysis) pro tips video (link TBP). This will be more detail and a quick walk-thru example of how to do the food blog analysis (due Friday).  

### Wed 12/02
NO READING

### Fri 12/04
{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Food Blog Analysis' text="
As a preparatory exercise for the final, your [food blog analysis](food-blog-analysis) is due today. We have read a lot about explicit dietary advice, but obviously a lot of what we 'know' about health and diet comes from packages, ads, cookbooks, and so on. What can modern food blogs tell us about the relationship between food, health, and diet? What issues have we covered in class are present or missing?
