# Reading Reflections
You have a short reading response due most days there is a reading assignment. The syllabus makes it very clear what you need to do and when.

To improve the utility of these responses, the class will be divided into two groups. You need to remember if you are Group 1 or Group 2.



## Most Mondays (after the first week, anyway)
Group 1: You will post to the discussion board a brief statement of what you found most interesting about the readings. Think about:
- What ideas did you find most interesting?
- What was most unclear or confusing?
- What questions did they bring up?


Group 2: You will post to the discussion board a brief argument of how that day's reading assignment connects/relates to the topic from the previous week. Think about:
- How does the reading extend ideas we've seen developing?
- How does the reading offer new perspectives on diet/health/nutrition?
- Do you find more continuity or discontinuity?


## Most Wednesdays
Group 1: You will compare/contrast the readings for today (Wednesday) compared to Monday. Usually, they are VERY different. Sometimes, the readings for M and W are chapters from the same book, so they are obviously similar, but you can still critique which you found to be more effective and WHY.

Group 2: You will post to the discussion board a brief statement of what you found most interesting about the readings. Think about:
- What ideas did you find most interesting?
- What was most unclear or confusing?
- What questions did they bring up?


## Fridays
There is never a reading response due Friday because there is either a weekly learning reflection, a special assignment, or nothing, due.


## Basics (both kickstarters AND commenters)
- ~200 words. Write more or less as you need/want to per assignment, but don't be consistently too much above or below 200 words.
- Original thinking! Avoid summarizing readings except to restate a point that you want to elaborate on.
- Informal writing (don't try to sound like an academic), but free of typos and basic grammatical errors. These are short posts, so it takes only a few minutes to revise them. Consistently sloppy posts will lower your grade by 1/3 to 2/3 grade (A to B+, for instance).
- Posted ON TIME at UNM Learn. ON TIME means by MIDNIGHT on the due date. Late posts are docked .5 points per day. Late work once in a while doesn't really affect your grade, but consistently late work does, and turning work in a day or two late is FAR BETTER than not at all.


## Questions to think about

## Connect, don't summarize
These posts are meant to be something of a creative exercise. I (and your classmates) are much more interested in reading about what YOU THINK, rather than a summary of the assignment. This exercise is NOT about just regurgitating information or identifying the "right" answer. **There is no right answer.** Everyone is going to have a different take on what's interesting, how things connect, how they don't etc. We can all learn a lot from each other.


## Scoring and how these factor in your grade
- 4 points: Your post clearly demonstrates broad familiarity with the assignment, original thinking, and is clearly articulated.

- 3 points: Your post demonstrates some familiarity with the assignment and some original thinking but could use refinement either in thinking or writing.

- 2 points: A decent effort, but doesn't show much engagement with the reading or is primarily summary rather than original thinking.

- 1 point: You posted _something_, but it looks like you were posting without reading much at all. Often such posts asks questions that are clearly addressed in the readings or ignorantly contradict them (as opposed to carefully argue against them).

- 0 points: Nothing posted, or otherwise so unintelligible that I can't even guess at what you were trying to do.


The idea here is that these weekly posts should in sum account for a significant but not large portion of your final grade without being unduly stressful to complete.

Bottom line: missing a few posts here and there won't affect your grade, but if you're consistently missing them or not adding value to the discussion, they end up lowering your grade by 1/3 (like A to A-) or 2/3 (like B+ to B-).
