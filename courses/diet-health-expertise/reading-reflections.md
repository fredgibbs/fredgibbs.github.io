# Reading Reflections
You have a short reading response due most days there is a reading assignment. The syllabus makes it very clear what you need to do and when.

These are meant to be somewhat creative exercises to get you to compare and contrast different aspects of the reading and to indicate what you thought was most interesting about them (we all find different things interesting!). These are NOT intended to be boring academic regurgitations of the readings. You don't want to write those, and I don't want to read them. The best advice I can give: be yourself!

Beginning on the third week, the class will be divided into two groups. You only need to remember if you are in Group 1 or Group 2. The schedule page makes clear what your group is doing for each day (or if there is no group assignment). In other words, the schedule page will tell you what kind of response you're supposed to write; this page describes the different kinds of responses. There are three kinds of responses that you'll be asked to do:

## Standard Reflection
Provide a brief statement of what you found most interesting about the readings. Think about:
- How can you address the questions for the reflection prompt?
- What ideas did you find most interesting?
- What was most unclear or confusing?
- What questions did they bring up?

## Connective Reflection
Provide a brief argument of how that day's reading assignment connects/relates to the topic from the previous week. Think about:
- How does the reading extend ideas we've seen developing?
- How does the reading offer new perspectives on diet/health/nutrition?
- Do you find more continuity or discontinuity?

## Comparative Reflection
Compare/contrast the readings for today (Wednesday) compared to Monday. Usually, they are VERY different. Sometimes, the readings for M and W are chapters from the same book, so they are obviously similar, but you can still critique which you found to be more effective and WHY.


## Fridays
There is never a reading response due Friday because there is either a weekly learning reflection, a special assignment, or nothing, due.


## Basics
- ~150--200 words. Write more or less as you need/want to per assignment, but don't be consistently too much above or below the target.
- Original thinking! Avoid summarizing readings except to restate a point that you want to elaborate on.
- Informal writing (don't try to sound like an academic), but free of typos and basic grammatical errors. These are VERY short posts, so it takes only a few minutes to revise them. Consistently sloppy posts will lower your grade by 1/3 to 2/3 grade (A to B+, for instance).
- Posted ON TIME at UNM Learn. ON TIME means by MIDNIGHT on the due date. Late posts are docked .5 points per day. Late work once in a while doesn't really affect your grade, but consistently late work does, and turning work in a day or two late is FAR BETTER than not at all.


## Connect, don't summarize
These posts are meant to be something of a creative exercise. I (and your classmates) are much more interested in reading about what YOU THINK, rather than a summary of the assignment. This exercise is NOT about just regurgitating information or identifying the "right" answer. **There is no right answer.** Everyone is going to have a different take on what's interesting, how things connect, how they don't etc. We can all learn a lot from each other.


## Scoring and how these factor in your grade
- 2 points: Your post clearly demonstrates broad familiarity with the reading assignment, original thinking, and is clearly articulated.

- 1.5 points: Your post demonstrates some familiarity with the assignment and some original thinking but could use refinement either in thinking or writing.

- 1 points: A decent effort, but doesn't show much engagement with the reading or is primarily summary rather than original thinking.

- .5 point: You posted _something_, but it looks like you were posting without reading much at all. Often such posts asks questions that are clearly addressed in the readings or ignorantly contradict them (as opposed to carefully argue against them).

- 0 points: Nothing posted, or otherwise so unintelligible that I can't even guess at what you were trying to do.


The idea here is that these reflections should in sum account for a significant but not large portion of your final grade without being unduly stressful to complete. And they should hold everyone accountable for keeping up with the reading and not falling behind.

Bottom line: missing a few posts here and there won't affect your grade, but if you're consistently missing them or not adding value to the discussion, they end up lowering your grade by 1/3 (like A to A-) or 2/3 (like B+ to B-).
