# Links and Guides
This page contains a list of links that you will probably need repeatedly throughout the term.  There is nothing NEW on this page; all these links are explained in more detail on the syllabus home page.

## Submitting work and quizzes
- [UNM Learn](http://learn.unm.edu). All assignments will be submitted via UNM Learn.

## Readings
- We use [Zotero](http://zotero.org) to manage course readings. See the [Zotero guide](http://fredgibbs.net/courses/etc/zotero) for an overview of the tool, and instructions on how to join the course library.

- [Zotero course library](https://www.zotero.org/groups/642043/diet-health-expertise-unm/library). Note that anyone can VIEW the course library, but you can only access the PDF scans if you're logged in and have joined the group library.

## Videos
- The course [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCt6_7arYzi4TcIIwo7TLURw) will host mini-lectures and other screencasts.

## General communication
- I have set up a [Slack workspace](http://diet-health-expertise.slack.com) so that we can communicate easily and informally. Feel free to never use it, be a fly on the wall, or be very active. Instructions to join are on the syllabus home page.
