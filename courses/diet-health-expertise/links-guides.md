# Links and Guides
This page summarizes course resource links that you will probably need repeatedly throughout the term.  There is NOTHING NEW on this page; all these links are explained in more detail on the syllabus home page.

## Submitting work and quizzes
- [Canvas](http://canvas.unm.edu). All assignments will be submitted here; all quizzes are here, etc. The syllabus is NOT ON CANVAS. 

## Readings
- We use [Zotero](http://zotero.org) to manage course readings. See the [Zotero guide](http://fredgibbs.net/courses/guides/zotero) for an overview of the tool, and instructions on how to join the course library.

- [Zotero course library](https://www.zotero.org/groups/642043/diet-health-expertise-unm/library). Note that anyone can VIEW the course library, but you can only access the PDF scans if you're logged in and have joined the group library. If you can't see the PDFs, see the [Zotero guide](http://fredgibbs.net/courses/guideszotero) for troubleshooting.

## Videos
- The course [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCt6_7arYzi4TcIIwo7TLURw) has all recorded videos.

## Assignment Guides
- [Reading Reflections](reading-reflections)
