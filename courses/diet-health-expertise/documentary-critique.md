# Documentary Critique

## Objective
This assignment encourages you to bring what we've learned in class in critiquing and analyzing a documentary focused on diet and health.

## Basics
- ~750 words
- 1.5 line spacing
- 11pt Times New Roman
- Free of typos and basic grammatical errors
- Clear and focused writing (no stream of consciousness nonsense)

## Questions to consider
- BRIEFLY summarize the plot/narrative arc
- What is the moral or take home message? 
- What important points does it make?
- Who is the intended audience? Who is NOT the intended audience?
- What kind of assumptions does it make about diet/health/nutrition?
- How does the film establish its expertise as a way of convincing you about something?
- Where could the history of diet and health play a stronger role?

## MOST IMPORTANT QUESTION TO ADDRESS
- How does this film reflect contemporary (meaning the time it was made) attitudes toward diet and health?

## Analyze! Don't summarize
- You are being evaluated on the quality/depth of your ANALYSIS! While a brief description and summary of the film is necessary, it should serve as an introduction to your analysis, which will comprise almost all of your essay.
