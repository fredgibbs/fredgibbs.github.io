# Reading Connections

## Monday Kickstarters
Most Mondays (after the first week, anyway), half the class will post to the discussion board a brief argument of how that day's reading assignment connects/relates to the topic from the previous week. Some days, there the way it connects is that it's a completely different way of thinking about nutrition, so you might talk about what's different and WHY. Other days, it's a subtle but significant change, so you might talk about what's different and WHY. Other days, there might be another example of something we looked at earlier in the course, so you can talk about what's different and WHY. Get the idea? Make a (not THE) connection and explain differences.

## Wednesday Commenters
Every Wednesday, the other half of the class will respond to / comment on the the Kickerstarters, using that day's (Wednesday's) reading to pick up and advance an earlier conversation. This isn't just a "yes i agree"-type-response, but an effort to substantively build off what someone else has started and take their ideas further or argue why a different approach might be more productive.

In sum: each week you have one post due, either on Monday or Wednesday. Every week, everyone will switch groups so that you will alternate being a kickstarter or a commenter (and thus alternate the day you need to post). The schedule should make VERY clear who is doing what on each day. Let me know if that's not the case!


## Basics (both kickstarters AND commenters)
- ~200 words. Write more or less as you need/want to per assignment, but don't be consistently too much above or below 200 words.
- Original thinking! Avoid summarizing readings except to restate a point that you want to elaborate on.
- Informal writing (don't try to sound like an academic), but free of typos and basic grammatical errors. These are short posts, so it takes only a few minutes to revise them. Consistently sloppy posts will lower your grade by 1/3 to 2/3 grade (A to B+, for instance).
- Posted ON TIME at UNM Learn. ON TIME means by MIDNIGHT on the due date. Late posts are docked .5 points per day. Late work once in a while doesn't really affect your grade, but consistently late work does, and turning work in a day or two late is FAR BETTER than not at all.


## Questions to think about
- What ideas did you find most interesting?
- What was most unclear or confusing?
- What questions did they bring up?
- How did the reading(s) alter your thinking about food (or not)?
- What topics weren't addressed but should have been?
- How do the readings agree or disagree with each other?
- How do the readings overlap with previous readings?

## Connect, don't summarize
These posts are meant to be something of a creative exercise. I'm much more interested in reading about how YOU think the readings/topics can be connected than reading a summary of the assignment. This exercise is NOT about just regurgitating information or identifying the "right" answer. **There is no right answer.** Everyone is going to have a different take on how the topics and readings can be connected.


## Scoring and how these factor in your grade
- 2 points: Your post clearly demonstrates broad familiarity with the assignment, original thinking, and is clearly articulated.

- 1.5 points: Your post demonstrates some familiarity with the assignment and some original thinking but could use refinement either in thinking or writing.

- 1 point: A decent effort, but doesn't show much engagement with the reading or is primarily summary rather than original thinking.

- .5 point: It looks like you just posted something to fulfill the assignment without reading very carefully. Often such posts asks questions that are answered in the readings or ignorantly contradict them (as opposed to carefully argue against them).

- 0 points: Nothing posted


The idea here is that these weekly posts should in sum account for a significant but not large portion of your final grade without being unduly stressful to complete.

Bottom line: missing a few posts here and there won't affect your grade, but if you're consistently missing them or not adding value to the discussion, they end up lowering your grade by 1/3 (like A to A-) or 2/3 (like B+ to B-).
