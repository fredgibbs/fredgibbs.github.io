# Reading Connections

## Monday kickstarters
Every Monday, half the class will post to the discussion board a brief argument of how that day's reading assignment connects to the topic from the previous week. Some days, there the way it connects is that it's a completely different way of thinking about nutrition. Other days, it's a subtle but significant change. Other days, there might be another example of something we looked at earlier in the course.

## Wednesday commenters
Every Wednesday, the other half of the class will respond to the the kickerstarters, using that day's reading to pick up the conversation. This isn't just a "yes i agree"-type-response, but an effort to build off what someone else has started and take it further or even in a different direction.

In sum: each week you have one post due, either on Monday or Wednesday. Every week, everyone will switch groups so that you will alternate being a kickstarter or a commenter (and thus alternate the day you need to post).


## Basics
- ~200--250 words
- Informal, but free of typos and basic grammatical errors
- Original thinking
- Posted ON TIME at UNM Learn.

## Additional questions to think about
- What ideas did you find most interesting?
- What was most unclear or confusing?
- What questions did they bring up?
- How did the reading(s) alter your thinking about food (or not)?
- What topics weren't addressed but should have been?
- How do the readings agree or disagree with each other?
- How do the readings overlap with previous readings?

## Connect, don't summarize
These posts are meant to be something of a creative exercise. I'm much more interested in reading about how YOU think the readings/topics can be connected than reading a summary of the assignment. This exercise is NOT about just regurgitating information or identifying the "right" answer. There is no right answer. Everyone is going to have a different take on how the topics and readings can be connected.

## How these factor in your grade
If you put actual thought into your post (it's totally obvious when that happens as opposed to someone just posting something for sake of posting it) and post it on time, you get 1 point. If you post on time, but there isn't much substance to your post, you get .5 If you post late, but it's thoughtful, you get .5 point. If you don't post anything, or you post late and it's trivial, you get 0 points. Bottom line: missing a few posts here and there won't affect your grade, but if you're consistently missing them or not adding value to the discussion, they end up lowering your grade by 1/3 (like A to A-) or 2/3 (like B+ to B-).
