## Course Description
While national parks may grab the headlines, the national historic trails have perhaps even more directly shaped the development of American history and national identities by cultivating migration, trade, community identity, ethnic diversity, and environmental change.

This multidisciplinary course (drawing from history, geography, archeology, anthropology, literature, and many others) will provide an introduction to the study, interpretation, and significance of the National Historic Trails System, including the challenges faced by the National Park Service (NPS) in administering them.

A significant portion of the course will also engage students as core contributors to new and ongoing research projects at the National Trails Intermountain Region Office. As preparation for research projects, course readings will address theoretical work in the spatial humanities, general themes pertinent to historic trails, and more in-depth studies of particular trails. Students will gain fluency with primary sources, maps, and recent scholarship.

Throughout the course we'll also discuss broad questions about historic preservation: What constitutes a historic trail? How does a historic trail retain cultural significance? What are the challenges and strategies in communicating about the trails to a 21st-century audience? Are there modern day equivalents of the original historic trails? How can trails reveal new perspectives on overland migration generally? Studying the National Historic Trails as conduits for cultural exchange provides a fresh take on the American experience.


## Student Learning Outcomes
- Practical work with historical sources, including analysis, contextualization, and interpretation.
- Develop research and writing skills relevant to careers in the humanities, historical interpretation, museum studies, and public history (and basically everything else).
- Use native, environmental, and spatial history to highlight historic trails as crucial parts of our national heritage, including myths of the American frontier, and as under-appreciated linkages between vastly different cultural and natural ecosystems.
- Learn to think about theoretical and practical issues surrounding interpretation and administration of national historic trails and public history more generally.
