## Course Description
With ubiquitous digital maps at our finger tips, itâ€™s easy to move through space without giving it much thought. At the same time, we recognize that physical space connects us to our past and charts a course for the future. This multidisciplinary course draws from history, geography, archeology, anthropology, literature, cultural studies and architecture to explore the how we attach meanings to space and how both space and place influence our identities, communities, regions, and nations. Coursework contributes to ongoing projects at the National Park Service on the National Historic Trails (particularly historic sites on the Santa Fe Trail), emphasizing qualitative research and historical writing for a broad audience with digital publication technologies.


## Student Learning Outcomes
- Articulate how landscapes of all kinds mediates our relationship to the past, present, and future.
- Practical work with historical sources, including analysis, contextualization, and interpretation.
- Develop research and writing skills relevant to careers in the humanities, historical interpretation, museum studies, and public history (and basically everything else).
- Learn to think about theoretical and practical issues surrounding interpretation and administration of national historic trails.
