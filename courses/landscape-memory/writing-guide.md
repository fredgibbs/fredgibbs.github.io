## So What?
Make sure the essay very near both the beginning and the end makes it very clear what the reader is to take away as the main points. In other words, the essay needs to very obviously answer the SO WHAT question. This is something you need to do THROUGHOUT your essay in different ways, not just once in the intro.

## Narrative thread
Make sure you have one!

## Geographical Perspective
Make sure you are just listing places or areas that are important to your site. You want to provide a description of where that place is in relation to other stuff. Think at small and large scales. What other buildings are nearby? Or on the same street? What are the closest towns? What are the prominent geographic features?

## Critical Reflection on Landscape and Memory
This is not just an essay about a historic site--it's a chance for you to show me what you learned from the earlier readings. You won't cite everything and you shouldn't try to cram everything in. But your essay needs to take advantage of our more abstract and theoretical readings as well to help us think more deeply about our sites and what they should or shouldn't mean for us today. This is also a chance for you to connect the past, present, and future of your historic site.

## History
- Historical summary must include parenthetical citations to reputable sources with precise and unambiguous citations (author, page)
- Statements that are not common knowledge must have citations; you can can provide a single citation for a paragraph if you are paraphrasing 1 or 2 sources
- As historical essays, contextualization is everything. This is only possible with very broad and wide-ranging research.

## Paragraphs

### First sentences
Informative first sentences have a clear progression through the essay.

### Paragraph lengths
There is nothing intrinsically wrong with long paragraphs, but long paragraphs are quite difficult to read on a screen, and are also rather off-putting to new readers confronted with a wall of text.

### Focused paragraphs
Especially since you'll be paying attention to paragraph lengths, make sure paragraphs have an obvious point. Paragraphs are visual representations of ideas, so each paragraph should have one main idea connected to what comes before and after it.

## Just say no to strangers
Do not mention people who do not figure prominently in your essay (unless just mentioning them parenthetically as examples). Ideally all people and their key work (usually there is just one under discussion) will be linked to more extensive biographies like Wikipedia pages AND have a short introductory blurb in the text.

## Be explicit
**Here's an example of expanding an important point that is way too compressed into something longer but much clearer.** Obviously you're not going to do this sort of thing for every sentence, but if you can do it for the most important points, future readers will get a lot more out of these guides---and come away with a very different perspective and appreciation of history!

### Before
Augustine's _City of God_ made history of human affairs seem less relevant because we are all simply living out God's preordained plan.

### After
[St. Augustine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustine_of_Hippo) (354--430), regarded as one of the most important Church fathers and early Christian theologians, suggested that the history of human affairs was less relevant than Biblical history because humans are simply living out God's preordained plan. This view emerges in part from his classic work [_City of God_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_City_of_God), written to show that Christianity was not responsible for the fall of Rome, and which emphasizes how we are merely passing through the temporal and corrupt Earthly City on our way (with proper behavior) to the eternal and perfect City of God.


## Images and Captions
- Images make the essays WAY more interesting. Let's aim for 3-5 images per essay, ideally most of them historic.
- Images should be related to nearby text
- Images should be provocative and engage the reader
- Captions should be more than a simple label of what the image is, but how what the image is or what it represents is significant to historiography


## Standardized typography and links
- Appropriate formatting for section headings
- No overuse of bold or italics
- Effective use of hyperlinks to related pages, including the linked text and external site


## General Readability
Our essays need to be skimmable. That is, if someone is quickly scrolling through the page and glancing at headings, a sentence here and there, and images/captions, they should still learn something. And hopefully will be inspired to read more carefully.

If you've followed the guide, these should already be in place, but make sure your essay has:
- Clear narrative thread
- Meaningful headings that help guide the reader
- Paragraph first sentences that clearly indicate paragraph topic; new ideas should get new paragraphs
- Smooth transitions between paragraphs and between sections
- Clear and readable text that's free of typos, sentence fragments, and simple sentences
- Consistency in how you provide context about people, places, and events
- Captions that make useful points about your topic (not just the image), even if just skimming through them
