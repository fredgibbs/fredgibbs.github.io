# Historic Site Style Guide
It's very useful for us to have a style guide to make sure we're formatting our essays consistently. This is IN ADDITION to the [general rubric](http://fredgibbs.net/courses/trails/essay-grading-rubric.pdf).

## Headings
- The first thing on your page should be your site title in H1, like `# title` in Markdown.
- All subsequent headings should be in H2, like `## subheading`
- If you want to use a sub sub heading, great! (`### subsubheading`)
- All headings should use TITLE CASE, like "Mary had a Little Lamb"

## Image Captions
- Sorry this didn't work as expected. Instead of the footnote code, just use a regular link like [source](http://someurl) at the end of your caption, where `someurl` will be the page where you got the image.
- You can also, instead of "source" as the linked text, use the name of the source like "Wikipedia" of "Library of Congress"


## Horizontal Rules
- These should be kept to a minimum, within your essay but you can use them where you really want them
- BUT, do not use them around the heading or the top of the page
- DO put one at the very end of the body of your essay, and between all subsequent sections (directions for visiting, address, etc)

### Related People, Places, Articles
- Headings should be in H5 (`#####`)
- Make sure your references are formatted as a list

## Bibliography
- Your bibliography should be the last thing on the pages and have a horizontal rule right above it
- Use title (in H2) of "Bibliography" (not works cited, nor works consulted, nor anything else)
- Make sure your references are formatted as a list or are separate paragraphs and looks nice
- We decided on CHICAGO style
- Make sure the references are unambiguous and as precise as possible
- Minimize ugly URLS on the page; make sure they are hyperlinked

### HOW TO FORMAT Registration Forms Citations
As taken from [NPS.gov](https://www.nps.gov/subjects/nationalregister/frequently-asked-questions.htm). Choose whichever is easier for your particular form.

#### EITHER
_National Register of Historic Places, property name, town, county, state, reference number._

National Register of Historic Places, Lamesa Farm Workers Community Historic District, Los Ybanez, Dawson County, Texas, National Register #93000771.

#### OR
_Straw, Elizabeth A. "Cumberland Homesteads Historic District." National Register of Historic Places Inventory/Nomination Form. Tennessee Historic Commission, Nashville, September 20, 1988._

(Elizabeth A. Straw wrote the nomination; she worked for the Tennessee Historical Commission; and the date is the date the property was listed in the National Register of Historic Places.)



## Unsure or confused?
- Look at other essays to get ideas of what other people are doing
- Decide how much you should do something similar or if you really need to do something else (and it's OK if you do)
- Essays don't have to match perfectly, but we should keep stylistic deviations to a minimum and for specific reasons other than laziness or ignorance.
