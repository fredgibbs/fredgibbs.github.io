### Wednesday, 10/30: Santa Fe Trail History

- [A History of the Santa Fe Trail](https://www.santafetrail.org/the-trail/history/history-of-the-sft/)
- Selections from the NPS [Santa Fe History](https://dnr.mo.gov/shpo/nps-nr/64500309.pdf). This is a kind of historic registry nomination form intended to be for all historic sites near the Santa Fe Trail rather than a single specific site, as is more common. It begins with a long and thorough history (with just under 800 footnotes), and also has a long bibliography that we'll want to keep an eye on. We're reading from section E (Statement of Historic Contexts), which starts on page 3 of the PDF, but is labeled as E1 on the document (yay bureaucracy!). All pages are as listed in the document, not what your PDF reader says.
  - Make sure you at least skim everything and read carefully what interests you. Some paragraphs have lots of detail to support a larger point; obviously we're not concerned with minute detail, but it helps indicate what we know and what we don't about the Trail. Read extra quickly over those bits.
  - Introduction (1-6)
  - Part I (13-38)
  - Part II (39-44)
  - Part III (44-47)
  - Part IV (57-middle 59)

- Critique the [SFTA Interactive Trail Map](https://www.santafetrail.org/the-trail/history/history-of-the-sft/)
- Critique the [Santa Fe Trail Exhibits](https://www.nps.gov/safe/learn/historyculture/exhibits.htm)
- Explore the histories of the [NTIR Historic Trails](https://www.nps.gov/orgs/1453/index.htm).
- [Santa Fe Walking Tour](https://www.santafetrail.org/chapters/endoftrail/pdf/M-Pitel_SantaFesSFTWalkingTourFinal.pdf)

- What do you think of the information / histories presented in these contexts? Strengths? Weaknesses?

###  Monday 11/11: Deconstructing Maps
- J. B. Harley, "Deconstructing the Map," *Cartographica* 26, no. 2 (1989): 1--20. Note that Harley can veer into the philosophical weeds at times, but it's never for very long, so don't give up. On the whole, he makes a lot of very important points about reading and understanding maps that are stated very clearly.


### Wednesday, 11/13:



## Week 14/6: Trail Accounts and Diaries

### Monday, 11/18:
- Josiah Gregg, *Commerce of the Prairies: Or, the Journal of a Santa Fé Trader, during Eight Expeditions across the Great Western Prairies, and a Residence of Nearly Nine Years in Northern Mexico* Vol. II, 5th ed. (Philadelphia: J. W. Moore, 1855). [Google Books](https://books.google.com/books?id=3WHZTsz38gwC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Commerce+of+the+Prairies&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjU3cOkidncAhUpllQKHRJYCUUQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&q=Commerce%20of%20the%20Prairies&f=false) Recommended: 105-158. What did you learn about commerce?

- James A. Little, _What I Saw on the Old Santa Fe Trail: A Condensed Story of Frontier Life Half a Century Ago_ (Plainfield, IN: Friends Press, 1904). [Google Books](https://books.google.com/books?id=03FNAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false) Recommended: All the random stuff before the table of contents; also, 11-38.

How would you characterize the tone of these books? What are the assumptions and cultural frameworks of the authors? To what extent is it possible to capture the richness of these experiences/accounts in modern trail interpretation and administration? Or maybe we should put them behind us and keep them out of view?

### Wednesday, 11/20:

- Read quickly through "Susan Shelby Magoffin: A Wandering Princess on the Santa Fe Trail," in Deborah Lawrence, *Writing the Trail: Five Women's Frontier Narratives* (Iowa City: University of Iowa Press, 2006), 9--34. This very clearly describes how to interpret primary sources from the trail. Don't worry about the details, but do appreciate how the author of the article is trying to read between the lines of the diary and extract larger meaning from the minutia recorded therein.

-   Virginia Scharff, *Twenty Thousand Roads: Women, Movement, and the West* (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2003), 35--66.

-  Consult the diaries of Harriett Bidwell Shaw, available [here](https://www.kansasmemory.org/item/display.php?item_id=209694&f=00059118). Note the handwriting and how fun it would be to read it in the original. Luckily, someone has already done very useful transcription work for us. To actually read the diary, click on the "text version" button. You don't need to read every entry, but the more the better. Read enough to get a sense of her worldview, and what her diary tells us about trail travel in the mid nineteenth century. Please come to class ready to discuss how the diary---both what it says and what it doesn't---tells us about trail life.
