- Introduction to the [National Historic Registry](https://www.nps.gov/subjects/nationalregister/index.htm) and tips for finding historic registration forms for your research.



## Week 11/3

### Monday, 10/28: NO CLASS but...
- [A History of the Santa Fe Trail](https://www.santafetrail.org/the-trail/history/history-of-the-sft/)
- Selections from the NPS [Santa Fe History](https://dnr.mo.gov/shpo/nps-nr/64500309.pdf). This is a kind of historic registry nomination form intended to be for all historic sites near the Santa Fe Trail rather than a single specific site, as is more common. It begins with a long and thorough history (with just under 800 footnotes), and also has a long bibliography that we'll want to keep in mind. We're reading from section E (Statement of Historic Contexts), which starts on page 3 of the PDF, but is labeled as E1 on the document (yay bureaucracy!). All pages below are as listed in the document, not what your PDF reader says.
  - Make sure you at least skim everything and read carefully what interests you. Some paragraphs have lots of detail to support a larger point; obviously we're not concerned with minute detail, but it helps indicate what we know and what we don't about the Trail. Read extra quickly over those bits.
  - Introduction (1-6)
  - Part I (13-38)
  - Part II (39-44)
  - Part III (44-47)
  - Part IV (57-middle 59)
  - Part V (62-top 67)


### Wednesday, 10/30: NO CLASS but... <-- THIS IS NEW!
No meeting today so you have more research time.

In light of the "official" Santa Fe trail historic registry report, how does that kind of work get reflected (or not) in most easy to find digital resources? What do you think of the information / histories presented in these contexts? Strengths? Weaknesses?

- [Santa Fe Trail on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Fe_Trail)
- [Official NPS site](https://www.nps.gov/safe/index.htm) and the [Santa Fe Trail Exhibits](https://www.nps.gov/safe/learn/historyculture/exhibits.htm)
- [Santa Fe Trail Association](https://www.santafetrail.org/index.html) and their [Interactive Trail Map](https://www.santafetrail.org/interactive-trail-map/).
- [Santa Fe Walking Tour](https://www.santafetrail.org/chapters/endoftrail/pdf/M-Pitel_SantaFesSFTWalkingTourFinal.pdf)

{% include alert.html class='warning' title='Begin Your Historic Site Essay Research' text="
- Pick a historic site that does not appear on the [trails site](http://trails.unm.edu) from the [National Register Research Page](https://www.nps.gov/safe/learn/historyculture/national-register-research.htm), or the [Certified Sites Page](https://www.nps.gov/safe/getinvolved/certified-sites.htm). ADD (do not delete anything) your site to our [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yLBM4Aik6yEJ90XET5_GBrZ58gr1Mbjsg-NvyWrj0_8/edit#gid=0).
- To begin your research, start by Googling for your historic site. This sounds like a silly way to begin serious academic research, but it will become clear why it's actually the most useful approach for us and our sources. It also helps you get a lot information about your site (although the reliability will vary) in a short time.
- Usually, Wikipedia pages are an excellent place to begin because they provide references to the Historic Registration Forms and other useful bibliographic references. When you start you are really hunting for leads (people, places, events, etc) that you add to your search queries.
- You can almost always find your site on a Wikipedia list of Historic Places on the National Register, by searching for state and county. For example, each state has a page [like this one for Kansas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Register_of_Historic_Places_listings_in_Kansas). Find the page for the state or county your site is in.
- Make sure you look through resources available through State Historical Society websites (which one you'll use depends on what state your site is in). Keep an eye out for digital collections that are a great source of photographs, diaries, etc.
- Search Google Books for your historic site (usually with 'santa fe trail' as part of the search) to find not only existing scholarship, but also printed diaries an other first person trail accounts.
- Google Scholar is an excellent way to find more academic sources for your bibliographies, especially if you end up with a lot of commercial results to sort through.
- There is no one approach or technique for finding all the digital stuff we can about our historic sites, so be creative! Our main contribution to understanding the Santa Fe trail is bringing together really fascinating historical resources and accounts that are spread out among lots of different kinds of sites.

### Important places to search for your historic sites
- [WorldCat](https://unm.worldcat.org/): the best place to search for scholarly sources about your topic or related topics (like commerce on the Santa Fe Trail)
- [Google Books](https://books.google.com/): perfect for older sources that are now in the public domain
- [HathiTrust Digital Library](http://www.hathitrust.org): lots of older books and government reports, complete with a useful full-text search tool
- [Archive.org](http://www.archive.org): specializes in multimedia, but some scans may be better quality than others
- [Chronicling America](https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/): one the best sources for old digitized newspapers, easily searchable. You can quickly find stuff [like this](https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83040198/1912-05-10/ed-1/seq-3/#date1=1789&index=0&rows=20&words=Pawnee+Rock&searchType=basic&sequence=0&state=&date2=1963&proxtext=pawnee+rock&y=0&x=0&dateFilterType=yearRange&page=1) (to use a site we explored last class)
- [Rocky Mountain Online Archive](https://rmoa.unm.edu/): digitized photos, maps, and documents from libraries around the Southwest
- [Kansas Historical Society](https://www.kshs.org/p/research/19385) and the [Kansas Memory Digital Collection](https://www.kansasmemory.org/)
- [Missouri State Historical Society Digital Collections](https://digital.shsmo.org/)
- [New Mexico Digital Collections](https://econtent.unm.edu/): New Mexico-specific online archive with legal documents, diagrams, and historic newspapers

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='SITE SYNOPSIS DUE MONDAY' text="

- For Monday, there are THREE components of your final essay you need to have completed (as drafts).
  - Write a 500-600 word outline/synopsis of your historic site. Summarize its original significance, its legacy, the landscape/space, relevant people associated with it, and how different people might have viewed it differently.
  - Don't worry about producing great prose. You're just trying to give some shape to your ideas. Bullet points are fine, but make them complete ideas. How you describe the significance will vary by the kind of site. Buildings have people associated with them; wagon ruts or river crossings are more closely tied to geography (and what they connect).
  - Your synopsis should begin to describe the SPATIAL CONTEXT of the site during the Santa Fe Trail years, but also how it functions today (why are we preserving it? what are we really preserving?).
  - You are not just regurgitating facts about it, but telling a compelling story.
  - Use the readings done previously on landscape and memory to address broader issues that will help change the way your readers think.
  - Compile a bibliography of 5-10 sources you will use as the basis of your essay. **These need to be published academic sources.** You will add to this list, and maybe subtract from it, so don't worry about getting it perfect.
  - Compile a list of relevant websites (however many you find useful) that have information about your site. It is very important that we know about these, and use them as appropriate (we will link to the best ones in our essays), but we will not be citing these in our bibliographies.
- These synopses will be integral to your final essays, so time spend on them now will save you much time later, when you will have much less of it.
- Make sure your essays are double spaced with 1\" margins so we can scribble on them next class.

## Week 14/6: Trail Accounts and Diaries

### Monday, 11/18:
- Josiah Gregg, *Commerce of the Prairies: Or, the Journal of a Santa Fé Trader, during Eight Expeditions across the Great Western Prairies, and a Residence of Nearly Nine Years in Northern Mexico* Vol. II, 5th ed. (Philadelphia: J. W. Moore, 1855). [Google Books](https://books.google.com/books?id=3WHZTsz38gwC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Commerce+of+the+Prairies&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjU3cOkidncAhUpllQKHRJYCUUQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&q=Commerce%20of%20the%20Prairies&f=false) Recommended: 105-158. What did you learn about commerce?

- James A. Little, _What I Saw on the Old Santa Fe Trail: A Condensed Story of Frontier Life Half a Century Ago_ (Plainfield, IN: Friends Press, 1904). [Google Books](https://books.google.com/books?id=03FNAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false) Recommended: All the random stuff before the table of contents; also, 11-38.

How would you characterize the tone of these books? What are the assumptions and cultural frameworks of the authors? To what extent is it possible to capture the richness of these experiences/accounts in modern trail interpretation and administration? Or maybe we should put them behind us and keep them out of view?

### Wednesday, 11/20:

- Read quickly through "Susan Shelby Magoffin: A Wandering Princess on the Santa Fe Trail," in Deborah Lawrence, *Writing the Trail: Five Women's Frontier Narratives* (Iowa City: University of Iowa Press, 2006), 9--34. This very clearly describes how to interpret primary sources from the trail. Don't worry about the details, but do appreciate how the author of the article is trying to read between the lines of the diary and extract larger meaning from the minutia recorded therein.

-   Virginia Scharff, *Twenty Thousand Roads: Women, Movement, and the West* (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2003), 35--66. [read online](https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/unm/reader.action?ppg=48&docID=223632&tm=1540682964396).

-  Consult the diaries of Harriett Bidwell Shaw, available [here](https://www.kansasmemory.org/item/display.php?item_id=209694&f=00059118). Note the handwriting and how fun it would be to read it in the original. Luckily, someone has already done very useful transcription work for us. To actually read the diary, click on the "text version" button. You don't need to read every entry, but the more the better. Read enough to get a sense of her worldview, and what her diary tells us about trail travel in the mid nineteenth century. Please come to class ready to discuss how the diary---both what it says and what it doesn't---tells us about trail life.



## Week 15/7:

### Monday, 11/25:
- Complete info for the directory page in our [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yLBM4Aik6yEJ90XET5_GBrZ58gr1Mbjsg-NvyWrj0_8/edit#gid=0)
- All historic site essays should be ENTIRELY COMPLETE, including clear section headings, clear and focused paragraphs, clear narrative thread, images (with captions), hyperlinks, and related people, places, and articles.
- Clean Zotero Collections
- Bring 2 printed versions to class for peer review

### Wednesday, 11/27:




## Week 16/8

### Monday, 12/02: NO CLASS --> WORK TIME

### Wednesday, 12/04
- Loose Ends, Reflections, and Evaluations
- TODO lists for final revisions

## All final versions December 11 at 5:00pm.
