### Thursday (Mar 28)
- Americo Paredes, _The Hammon and the Beans and Other Stories_ (Houston, TX: Arte Publico Press, 1994), 3-9.
  - How does intersectionality affect how space is conceived or structured? In other words, how is space modified by race, class, and gender? When reading Paredes think about what the landscape tells us about these positionalities. Who moves between the different spaces in the short story, who determines the spacial boundaries and their markers?  What can be read in this movement? As White states in What is Spatial History? (week 9!)  we "produce and reproduce space through our movements and the movements of goods..." and I would add the movement of ideologies as well.
