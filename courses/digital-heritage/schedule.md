- Marisa Elena Duarte and Miranda Belarde-Lewis, “Imagining: Creating Spaces for Indigenous Ontologies,” _Cataloging & Classification Quarterly_ 53, no. 5–6 (July 4, 2015): 677–702.


### FRI Feb 7: Getting Started with GitHub (keep links, but generalize instructions)

Peruse these beforehand:
- Introduction to [Markdown](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/)
  - For later reference, there's an easy [cheat sheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).
- Introduction to [GitHub](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/). Read through this tutorial, but do not actually do all the steps---just try to understand what's going on and we'll go over it.

{% include alert.html class='info' title='Do in class or ASAP afterward' text="
- As with all our other tools, we're using real world tools as part of our survey of digital interfaces to history.
- Create a free and secure account at [GitHub](http://github.com). You can pick any username/password you want---it's independent of UNM and Zotero.
- Add your GitHub username to our [shared Google Doc of GitHub usernames](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Egg3c8LxeUo54B63HqbC-d-MSWKClvjJVfhrzxwz_YI/edit?usp=sharing) by the end of the day, and I'll invite everyone to join our GitHub Team. Like Zotero, You'll get an email asking if you want to accept the invitation. Do it!
- Use either [Dillinger](https://dillinger.io/) or a text editor (like [Atom](https://atom.io)) to create a plaintext Markdown file with some dummy text that includes some Markdown formatting---this shows me you understand the basics of Markdown. Be sure to save it as `firstname-lastname.md` (example: `fred-gibbs.md`). The text in your file doesn't matter, but make sure your filename:
  - has no spaces
  - is all lower case
  - ends with `.md`
- Be sure you are logged into GitHub, then add your Markdown file to [our GitHub repository](https://github.com/unm-campus-histories/spaces). To do this, click on the `testfiles` folder, or simply click [HERE](https://github.com/unm-campus-histories/spaces/tree/master/testfiles) then drag and drop your file onto your browser window. You should see my own test file there, `fred-gibbs.md`. If you don't see my file, you're in the wrong place!
- Click the green 'Commit Changes' button near the bottom of the page.

- IN CLASS: Solve GitHub and Markdown problems


## 4: From Analog to Digital Archives

### MON Feb 10

- Skim through more examples [here](https://lab.sciencemuseum.org.uk/exploring-museum-collections-online-some-background-reading-da5a332fa2f8)

#### BEFORE CLASS
- Come to class ready to discuss your experience with some of the interfaces mentioned, or others that you've used for something that you've found interesting.


### FRI Feb 14 ❤️

- Search for a history book at https://unm.worldcat.org/ or https://library.unm.edu/, that is also held physically in one of our libraries at UNM, and note what you see in the first few pages of search results for that book.
- Note the library call number for the book, and go find it in the stacks.
- Browse around the book and note what kind of books are physically around it---look at a few shelves above and below, too, not just the few books on either side of your target book.
- Write up a standard essay (like transcription assignment) (~800 words) about how these two different browsing experiences compare.
- Obviously there's no right or wrong answer. But strive for clarity in your description of what you searched for, what you found in both cases, and how you might explain the differences.
- Graded on 0-10 point scale, like everything but reading responses.

#### Et cetera

### FRI Feb 28: NO CLASS -- WORK TIME!
- Get started with this over the weekend and bring questions to class on Monday.
- Review the [assignment guidelines](transcription-guidelines). (summarized below, but important details are on the guidelines page)
- Review some [transcription tips](https://www.archives.gov/citizen-archivist/transcribe/tips).
- Pick one of the transcription projects above.
- Transcribe at least THREE pages (can be sequential pages of the same document).
- Create screen shots of your work, including images of what you're transcribing and aspects of the interface that you comment on.
- Create a NEW PAGE in your portfolio for your ~800-word essay--this is not a blog post like reading responses--that describes and critiques your experience.
- Imagine that you're writing for other students in the class (so you don't need to introduce what a transcription project is, for example). We all know the general assignment, but you can't assume anyone is familiar with your site, interface, text, or experience.



## 7: ???

- Discussion of collaborative **20 point** [UNM spatial history project](unm-spatial-history-guidelines)
  - Before class, read the [UNM Spatial History Guidelines](unm-spatial-history-guidelines).
  - Remember this is a spatial history, not just a building history. For instance, keep in mind how sources like this [Co-Ed Code](https://digitalrepository.unm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1006&context=unm_coed_code) can help you.

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Choose your place' text="
- Before class, pick a building or space on campus. Buildings that no longer exist have important histories, too! Take a few minutes to find something that interests you.
- You can consult this [list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_University_of_New_Mexico_buildings) to get started, but you can do anything you want as long as no one else has claimed it.
- Add your name (in the author column) and building/place (in the place-name column) to our [UNM Campus History Index](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AE1X-dDphqyYjVlUj1w0xvWivnu0e7EtyxzuGNjbock/edit?usp=sharing)
  - Ignore all the other columns for now
  - Be careful with details! The Campus History website draws directly from the Google Sheet.

### Thursday (Apr 11)
{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Image Test' text='
- Building off our testfiles exercise: for today, put a sample Markdown file for your UNM space (with appropriate file name) in our repository. We are not using the `testfiles` folder anymore, but rather our [essays folder in the docs folder](https://github.com/unm-campus-histories/spaces/tree/master/docs/essays). In this folder you will see an `images` directory and my `mesa-vista-hall.md` sample file.
- You do not have to have done any research---you can simply use the text from [my sample file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/unm-campus-histories/spaces/master/docs/essays/mesa-vista-hall.md). Simply copy and paste this text into your editor---including the info at the very top--- save it as a text file, and drag and drop it into the essays folder, as you did in the previous exercise.
- PRO TIP: You can also create a file directly on GitHub by using the "Create New File" button, and copying and pasting text into the editor window. Remember to hit the green "Commit Changes" button.
- Your final essays will have lots of images in them, so we want to be sure everyone can display images in your place holder file.
- Find a test image to use (it does not have to be related to your campus space for this exercise) and download it to your computer. Rename the file according to our naming conventions (all lower case and dashes instead of spaces). The name should help you remember what the image is (keep in mind you will have lots of images to keep track of eventually).
- To display images, we need them in our repository. You can add images as you have created files. Navigate to the the [images folder](https://github.com/unm-campus-histories/spaces/tree/master/docs/essays/images) and either drag and drop a single file, or select bunch and drag them all at once(much easier!).
- You need to make sure the block of code that loads the image is customized to your image by changing the `caption` and `source` fields, but the `source` field must always start with `images/`
- If you use my sample, change `src="images/default.jpg"` to `src="images/YOUR-IMAGE-FILENAME.EXT"` but replace `YOUR-IMAGE-FILENAME.EXT` with the name of your image file.
- IMPORTANT: The filename in the quotes and the name of your image file MUST MATCH EXACTLY (see the yellow box below), including the extension. My sample image file uses `.jpg` but yours might be different (.jpeg, or .png or .JPG, etc)
- Notice that the GitHub page for your file (like [the Mesa Visa one](https://github.com/unm-campus-histories/spaces/blob/master/docs/essays/mesa-vista-hall.md)) makes your Markdown look nice (with headers and bold and so on) but it does not display images.
- To see if your images are working, go to your live webpage, which is at a URL like `https://unm-campus-histories.github.io/spaces/essays/mesa-vista-hall` except you need to replace `mesa-vista-hall` with the name of your file. We will have an easier way of doing that soon.
- Your webpage can take up to ten minutes to refresh when you make changes--usually just one or two minutes, but please be patient. Save yourself frustration by BEING CAREFUL with punctuation, ESPECIALLY WHEN CUTTING AND PASTING.
- For reference, consult the [THE CODE SAMPLES PAGE](https://unm-campus-histories.github.io/spaces/code)!

{% include alert.html class='warning' title='Image problems?' text="
If your image isn't showing up, there is 95% chance you referencing the wrong filename or folder. And a 5% chance you haven't put files in the right place.
- check the file extension (.jpg, .jpeg, .JPG, .png)
- check capitalization (mesa-vista is NOT THE SAME as Mesa-Vista)
- check for spaces and dashes (mesa-vista is NOT THE SAME as mesa vista)
- make sure your image file is where it is supposed to be, in `docs/essays/images`.
- make sure your place file is in the `docs/essays` folder, and the image path in your code starts with `images\`
