# Reading Response Guidlines
In ~300 words (ideally 2-3 short paragraphs), you have two goals: 1) to show me that you've read and thought critically about the reading; 2) to help advance our discussion about the reading, its utility, and how it fits into the course.


## Basic Requirements
- 250-350 words
- Clear, concise, and meaningful (no fluff!)
- No quotations, except short phrases that you want to critique directly
- 3-5 citations to specific pages, like (Burdick, 22)
- Posted to your blog before you go to bed the day before class
