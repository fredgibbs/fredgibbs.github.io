# Campus History Guidelines
This guide provides the instructions for our collaborative campus history assignment. You'll pick a particular building on campus---you can consult this [a list of options](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_University_of_New_Mexico_buildings). We'll each write a short history of that building based on archival sources from the Special Collections in Zimmerman (the Center for Southwest Research)---where almost all University archival materials are held. Librarians will help us find stuff, but it will be up to us to make good use of it.

This project will demonstrate what collaborative digital history can and should be, as we'll each contribute small articles that in themselves are not exactly profound, but collectively add up to something really useful that one person would be hard pressed to do nearly as well in a reasonable time. It will also help us critically reflect on the challenges in moving from analog archives to digital essays that take advantage of the medium to tell a compelling story.

Rather than post these on your digital portfolios, we're going to make a separate website together with some technologies that demonstrate the collaborative, open source potential for digital history.


## Research Process
- Pick a building that is or was on campus. Buildings that no longer exist have important spatial histories, too! Take a few minutes to find something that interests you.
- Go to the Center for Southwest Research in Zimmerman Library. Go in the main door, then make a U-turn to the left.
- Proceed to the round service kiosk, where you need to store your bags.
- Go in the Reading Room, find a computer, and navigate to the [Rocky Mountain Online Archive Advanced Search](https://rmoa.unm.edu/advanced.php)
- Enter the name of your building (you need to spell it right), and USE QUOTES if it's multiple words (or you'll get results with ANY of the words)
- For the Institutions field, pick "University of New Mexico Center for Southwest Research"
- Once you click on an item from the search results, note the "Collection Number" near the top of the page, and find the relevant Box number further down the page for the building you're looking for.
- Using that information, fill out the ACTUAL PAPER Request Form available at the front desk.
- Have fun rooting through the history of UNM's campus. It's not clear exactly what's in the boxes or how useful it will be for your essay, but that's the thrill of the hunt!
- Note that you should consult architectural drawings and campus plans, which go on a separate space on the form, but it's clear what to do).
- Take good notes, get good quotes, take pictures with your phone for your own reference (so you can examine stuff outside the reading room), and USE THE SCANNER in the reading room to create quality digital images for your digital essays.
- We are arbitrarily, but defensibly, limiting our sources to what we can find at CSWR (which is the official archive of the University), so don't worry about outside sources.

## Essay Requirements
- ~ 600 words (a little shorter than our others on purpose)
- Written in plain text using Markdown for formatting (review the links on the syllabus if you don't know what this means)
- 3 historical photographs (more is better)
- 2 images of primary sources (more is better, esp if you have a variety of KINDS of sources)
- 2 modern photographs of your building (or where it was)
- IMAGES MUST BE HIGH QUALITY SCANS/PHOTOS.
- Informative captions on your images that don't merely describe what the image is, but why it's significant.
- Subheadings to delineate your main topics and make your essay more skimmable.

## Style
- Write something you or your friends would want to read
- Aim for informal sophistication
- Demonstrate your expertise through description AND analysis

## Questions to keep in mind
- Who is our audience(s)?
- What do they know?
- What do we want them to know?
- How do we want them to think differently?

## Grading
- 0-2: Technically the assignment is done, but doesn't tell a cohesive story, has very limited images, or clearly rushed writing.
- 3-5: Displays a respectable level of effort, but generally underwhelming.
- 6-8: Shows potential, but falls short in scope or execution. Usually this score represents a solid effort that is missing a critical component or is sloppily done. For instance: too few  many images, weak captions, no real consideration of space, or campus development generally
- 9-10: Carefully and engagingly written; interesting images that give a sense of the archival history of UNM; tells a compelling story in a short space about the building, its space, and its relationship to campus; makes broader points about the potential of collaborative spatial history
