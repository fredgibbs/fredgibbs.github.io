# Campus History Guidelines
This guide provides the instructions for our collaborative campus history assignment. You'll pick a particular building on campus---you can consult this [a list of options](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_University_of_New_Mexico_buildings). We'll each write a short history of that building based on archival sources from the Special Collections in Zimmerman (the Center for Southwest Research)---where almost all University archival materials are held. Librarians will help us find stuff, but it will be up to us to make good use of it.

We are arbitrarily, but defensibly, limiting our sources to what we can find at CSWR (which is the official archive of the University), so don't worry about outside sources.

The University Archivist, [Portia Vescio](https://ulls.unm.edu/people/directory/v/vescio-portia.php), is excited about our project and we are all invited to email her (pvescio@unm.edu) with any questions!

This project will demonstrate what collaborative digital history can and should be, as we'll each contribute small articles that in themselves are not exactly profound, but collectively add up to something really useful that one person would be hard pressed to do nearly as well in a reasonable time. It will also help us critically reflect on the challenges in moving from analog archives to digital essays that take advantage of the medium to tell a compelling story.

Rather than post these on your digital portfolios, we're going to make a separate website together with some technologies that demonstrate the collaborative, open source potential for digital history.


## Research Process
- Pick a building that is or was on campus. Buildings that no longer exist have important spatial histories, too! Take a few minutes to find something that interests you.
- Add your name (in the author column) and building/place (in the place-name column) to our [UNM Campus History Index](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AE1X-dDphqyYjVlUj1w0xvWivnu0e7EtyxzuGNjbock/edit?usp=sharing)
  - Ignore all the other columns for now
  - Note that the data on this page will be used on our collaborative website, take care with details!
- Go to the Center for Southwest Research in Zimmerman Library. To get there, enter Zimmerman through the main door, then make a U-turn to the left. Note all the cool archival stuff in the display cases.
- Proceed to the round service kiosk, where you need to store your bags. You can take whatever you need into the reading room, except food/drink.
- Go in the Reading Room, find a computer, and navigate to the [Rocky Mountain Online Archive Advanced Search](https://rmoa.unm.edu/advanced.php)
- Enter the name of your building or place (you need to spell it correctly), and USE QUOTES if it's multiple words (or you'll get results with ANY of the words)
- For the Institutions field, pick "University of New Mexico Center for Southwest Research"
- Once you click on an item from the search results, note the "Collection Number" near the top of the page, and find the relevant Box number further down the page for the building you're looking for.
- Using that information, fill out the ACTUAL PAPER Request Form available at the front desk of the Reading Room.
- Have fun rooting through the history of UNM's campus. You never know exactly what will be in the boxes or how useful the stuff will will be for your essay, but that's the thrill of the hunt!
- Note that you should consult architectural drawings and campus plans, which go on a separate space on the form (but it's clear what to do).
- Take good notes, get good quotes, take pictures with your phone for your own reference so that you can examine stuff outside the reading room.
- USE THE SCANNER in the reading room to create quality digital images for your digital essays.


## Essay Requirements
- ~ 500-600 words (a little shorter than our others on purpose)
- Written in plain text using Markdown for formatting (review the links on the syllabus if you don't know what this means)
- 3 historical photographs (more is better)
- 2 images of primary sources (more is better, esp if you have a variety of KINDS of sources)
- 2 modern photographs of your building (or where it was)
- IMAGES MUST BE HIGH QUALITY SCANS/PHOTOS.
- Informative captions on your images that don't merely describe what the image is, but why it's significant.
- Subheadings to delineate your main topics and make your essay more skimmable.

## Style
- Write something you or your friends would want to read
- Aim for informal sophistication
- Demonstrate your expertise through description AND analysis

## Questions to keep in mind
- Who is our audience(s)?
- What do they know?
- What do we want them to know?
- How do we want them to think differently?

## Spatial Footprints
Since this is a SPATIAL history, we should have a map interface to what we're doing. So, we need a way of creating a clickable space on a web map. I'll handle the technical details, but you need to tell me where your building/place is.

- Go to [Google Maps](http://maps.google.com)
- Click the 3-line menu icon in the upper left of the search bar
- Click on "Your Places"
- Click on "Maps"
- Click "Create Map" at the bottom of the window pane
- Search for your building name or otherwise make sure the space you are researching is in your browser window. Close the pop-up if you get one.
- You can see the map layer you are creating is titled "Untitled Layer". That's not helpful. Change that to the name of your building/space, but **USE ALL LOWER CASE AND HYPHENS INSTEAD OF SPACES**, like `mesa-vista-hall`. Leave your map title as "Untitled Map".
- Click the little arrow to the left of "Base Map" at the bottom.
- Choose the Satellite view.
- Find a zoom level that allows you to see your place all at once.
- Click the "Draw a Line" icon under the search bar (it looks like a broken triangle).
- Click "Add line or shape"
- Trace out your place that you want to appear on our map. You are making a polygon, so make sure that your starting and ending points are the same. (This makes a polygon instead of a line)
- If you need to adjust a point, click the hand icon and drag whatever point you want to move.
- Click the 3-dot menu icon next to your map TITLE, which is probably still "Untitled Map" (NOT the layer title you changed)
- Click "Export to KML/KMZ"
- Choose to export just your layer, not the map
- Check the "Export to KML..." box (the bottom of the two)
- Upload the KML file (from your Downloads directory or wherever it ended up) to our `kml` folder in our repository.


## Grading
- 0-4: Technically the assignment is done, but doesn't tell a cohesive story, has very limited images, or clearly rushed writing.
- 5-9: Displays a respectable level of effort, but generally underwhelming.
- 10-16: Shows potential, but falls short in scope or execution. Usually this score represents a solid effort that is missing a critical component or is sloppily done. For instance: too few  many images, weak captions, no real consideration of space, or campus development generally
- 17-20: Carefully and engagingly written; interesting images that give a sense of the archival history of UNM; tells a compelling story in a short space about the building, its space, and its relationship to campus; makes broader points about the potential of collaborative spatial history
