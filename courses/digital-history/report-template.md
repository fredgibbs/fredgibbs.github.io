Digital History Progress Report

Dear ,

Because there has not been many opportunities for performance evaluation thus far, and I haven't done particularly well even with those, I'm writing to everyone in Digital History to provide a brief report on my assessment of your performance in the class so far. This is intended to give you a better idea of the status of completed work so far, and possible ways of improving your grade going forward.

## Participation
I don't keep track of specific points for participation in real time; you get assigned a number at the end of the term based on physical attendance and quality and quantity of contributions to the discussion. But it's still possible to say how you're doing in general and roughly where you are point-wise (although I resist exact calculations because that would give an impression of precision that participation grading doesn't really have).

Every class is worth about 1 point, and you get a percent of that based on your participation. We've had about 16 meeting, so a max of 16 points.

## Transcription Essay

### Pros
- Clear description of what you did
- Clear evaluation of project site and interface
- Distinct effort to integrate other course readings
- Thoughtful critical analysis of assignment in relation to course
- Generally easy to follow prose

### Cons
- Screenshots all bunched up
- Images don't have useful captions
- Essay doesn't do more than describe the assignment---that is, there's very little critical reflection.
- Unpolished writing that is harder to follow than it should be

Approximate point value as it stands:


## Moving Forward


Keep up the great work!

Keep up the good work!

The semester is flying by, but there's still a big chunk left, and I highly value improvement throughout the semester. So a strong performance throughout the rest of the term will be quite useful for your grade. The syllabus now details recommended draft due dates for all future assignments, so that you can get a preliminary

I'm sorry these have to be so brief, but I wanted to get them out to everyone ASAP. As always, please don't hesitate to get in touch if you'd like more detail or have any questions!

Cheers,
Fred
