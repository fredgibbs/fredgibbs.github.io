## Logistics

## Course Description
How can digital technology facilitate critical engagement with cultural heritage and its significance? How are cultural institutions are engaging with technology and what does the future look like? How can the digitization of historical artifacts--from pottery and jewelry to entire historic sites--change the ways we can understand past cultures? How can citizen science models energize the humanities? How is AI going to shape our access to and stories about the past? This is a class that's focused on discussing and making things, not just memorizing and regurgitating a historical facts. 

We'll examine how digital storytelling, virtual exhibits, digital historical tours, photogrammetry (3D modeling) of historic artifacts and sites, interface design for cultural collections, and digital mapping can help bring history and its relevance to life. We’ll draw from a wide range of fields including digital public history, historic preservation, museum studies, digital archiving, spatial humanities, and media studies. We'll collaborate on some posters, maps, 3D prints, digital essays, and a fictional interview with a campus building. Although we talk a lot about technology and this is a hands-on course (a laptop is helpful but not required), no technical skills are expected or needed--just an open mind about exploring the future of digital heritage!

### Absences Policy
Up to three unexcused absences are allowed without any grade penalty. However, after that, you lose roughly two points for every absence---so that basically every two missed classes lowers your grade one notch (B+ to B, for instance). Family or medical emergencies are excused absences, provided that you get in touch with me ASAP about them.

### Please Ask for Help
I heartily encouraged you to speak with me at any time about how I think you're doing in the class and how it can be improved (if at all). If life gets overwhelming during the course, it can be tempting to drift away from an elective course like this. Rather than disappear, please come talk with me about how we can accommodate your circumstances and thus avoid digging a huge hole from which it becomes increasingly difficult to escape.
