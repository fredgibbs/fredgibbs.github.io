## Course Description
This interdisciplinary course explores the effects of the digital age on producing and consuming history. Some guiding questions:

- How are historians adapting research and publication practices to use digitized archives and historical data?
- How does technology shape our access to the past?
- How does the Web change the kinds and forms of history that should be produced?
- How does the Web (and resources like Wikipedia) change perceptions of history?
- How can historians engage with these methods to improve information literacy?

In addressing these questions, we'll draw from contemporary readings in history, public history, historiography, digital humanities, literary studies, media studies, and library and museum studies. Along with our readings, we will investigate a variety of digital history, archival, and journalistic projects that feature various digital methods (such as text analysis, mapping, data visualization, and so on). We’ll critique the various facets of these projects (data, design, interface, utility, etc.) to understand the technologies and data involved.


## Student Learning Outcomes
- Think critically about how technology shapes our access to and interpretations of the past
- Examine the impact of the digitization of cultural heritage and how digital archives reshape our access to the past
- Begin to experiment with new tools, workflows, methods, and techniques for large-scale research questions in history
- Identify cultural and algorithmic biases in searching for historical information
- Critique how digital publishing challenges historical authority and expertise


## Work Requirements and Grading
NOTE THAT ALL WORK IS OPTIONAL! You need to do as many assignments to get whatever grade you want. There are more assignments given than anyone needs to do. Do the ones that interest you and do them well! Note that point values are the MAXIMUM possible, not what you get for merely completing them.

Because our various exercises are optional, so you can choose exercises that seem most interesting to you, you only have one real assignment---your digital portfolio that will showcase the exercises you have chosen to do.

Therefore, nothing is going to be officially graded before the end of finals week.

HOWEVER: You are encouraged to email me AT ANY TIME and AS MANY TIMES AS YOU WANT with a URL of an exercise or of your entire portfolio for an evaluation and grade estimate. I will get back to you as soon as I can.

### Absences Policy
Up to three unexcused absences are allowed without any grade penalty. However, after that, you lose roughly two points for every absence---so that basically every two missed classes lowers your grade one notch (B+ to B, for instance). If you reach ten absences, I will drop you from the course. Family or medical emergencies are excused absences, provided that you get in touch with me ASAP about them.

### Please Ask for Help
I heartily encouraged you to speak with me at any time about how I think you're doing in the class and how it can be improved (if at all). If life gets overwhelming during the course, it can be tempting to drift away from an elective course like this. Rather than disappear, please come talk with me about how we can accommodate your circumstances and thus avoid digging a huge hole from which it becomes increasingly difficult to escape.

## Readings
There are NO REQUIRED BOOKS for this course. But you will need to subscribe to the course Zotero library to access assigned articles. This will be discussed in class, but for reference, please see the [instructions for connecting](http://fredgibbs.net/courses/etc/zotero.html). The URL for the group library is [https://www.zotero.org/groups/1647219/digital-history-unm/items](https://www.zotero.org/groups/1647219/digital-history-unm/items).

## Students with Disabilities
The American with Disabilities Act (ADA) is a federal anti-discrimination statute that provides comprehensive civil rights protection for persons with disabilities. Among other things, this legislation requires that all students with disabilities be guaranteed a learning environment that provides for reasonable accommodations of their disabilities.

##Citizenship and/or Immigration Status
All students are welcome in this class regardless of citizenship, residency, or immigration status.  I will respect your privacy if you choose to disclose your status. As for all students in the class, family emergency-related absences are normally excused with reasonable notice to the professor, as noted in the attendance guidelines above.  UNM as an institution has made a core commitment to the success of all our students, including members of our undocumented community.  The Administration’s welcome is found on our website: http://undocumented.unm.edu/.
