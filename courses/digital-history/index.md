## Course Description
This interdisciplinary course explores the effects of the digital age on producing and consuming history. Some guiding questions:

- How are historians adapting research and publication practices to use digitized archives and historical data?
- How does technology shape our access to the past?
- How does the Web change the kinds and forms of history that should be produced?
- How does the Web (and resources like Wikipedia) change perceptions of history?
- How can historians engage with these methods to improve information literacy?

In addressing these questions, we'll draw from contemporary readings in history, public history, historiography, digital humanities, literary studies, media studies, and library and museum studies. Along with our readings, we will investigate a variety of digital history, archival, and journalistic projects that feature various digital methods (such as text analysis, mapping, data visualization, and so on). We’ll critique the various facets of these projects (data, design, interface, utility, etc.) to understand the technologies and data involved. Based on this work, we’ll collaboratively design and publish a website that showcases our rigorous reviews of these digital projects.


## Student Learning Outcomes
- Think critically about how technology shapes our access to and interpretations of the past
- Examine the impact of the digitization of cultural heritage and how digital archives reshape our access to the past
- Begin to experiment with new tools, workflows, methods, and techniques for large-scale research questions in history
- Identify cultural and algorithmic biases in searching for historical information
- Critique how digital publishing challenges historical authority and expertise

### Absences Policy
Up to three unexcused absences are allowed without any grade penalty. However, after that, you lose two points for every absence---so that roughly every two missed classes lowers your grade one notch (B+ to B, for instance). If you reach ten absences, I will drop you from the course. Family or medical emergencies are excused absences, provided that you get in touch with me ASAP about them.

### Please Ask for Help
I heartily encouraged you to speak with me at any time about how I think you're doing in the class and how it can be improved (if at all). If life gets overwhelming during the course, it can be tempting to drift away from an elective course like this. Rather than disappear, please come talk with me about how we can accommodate your circumstances and thus avoid digging a huge hole from which it becomes increasingly difficult to escape.

## Readings

## Students with Disabilities
The American with Disabilities Act (ADA) is a federal anti-discrimination statute that provides comprehensive civil rights protection for persons with disabilities. Among other things, this legislation requires that all students with disabilities be guaranteed a learning environment that provides for reasonable accommodations of their disabilities.

##Citizenship and/or Immigration Status
All students are welcome in this class regardless of citizenship, residency, or immigration status.  I will respect your privacy if you choose to disclose your status. As for all students in the class, family emergency-related absences are normally excused with reasonable notice to the professor, as noted in the attendance guidelines above.  UNM as an institution has made a core commitment to the success of all our students, including members of our undocumented community.
