### (Our Collaborative Digital History Project)

## Goals for the course
We've talked _ad nauseum_ about the advantages and limitations of digital archives and storytelling. In this assignment, you're going to write a history of your topic (that we decided much earlier) almost entirely from digital images.

Clearly, this is a highly restrictive and artificial limitation, but one that represents research in the real world, as there are always arbitrary limitations (whether geography, time or access, etc). It's also an extreme test of the power of digital essays to (potentially) create more engaging histories. In your essay, therefore, you should comment on how this kind of restriction affects your ability to tell an interesting and accurate story about your topic.

### IMPORTANT CLARIFICATION
Your research is not restricted to digital images, as that would be impossible, or so crude as to be useless. Your research will be the same as if you were writing a standard 5-page paper (or whatever). But you need to **TELL THE STORY THROUGH IMAGES**, with as little text as possible, and highly informative captions.


## Goals beyond the course
AS ALWAYS: Part of the goal of your digital portfolios is to show off ability to engage simultaneously with the potential and limitations of digital research. As always, imagine that you are writing this for a potential employer who is intrigued by the "Digital History" course on your transcript. Show them how you can tell a complex story effectively with digital media. And remember, this is one of many components of your portfolio---one that privileges the visual (you have lots of text elsewhere).


## Basic Requirements
- Needs to be a separate PAGE on your portfolio, NOT a blog post
- MAX 400 words, not counting captions. This does not mean essays are going to be SHORT, though, since you'll have a lot of images.
- Meaningful images---a set number is kind of silly given the variety of topics you've picked out, but you should have close to 10.
- Remember that not all images will be directly related to your topic---some will be for historical context.
- Your prose should fill in the gaps, but the images (and captions) are the heart of the story. THIS IS GOING TO BE VERY FRUSTRATING AND THAT'S THE POINT.
- I can't give precise formatting or layout requirements because there aren't any. The exercise is to think about how best to communicate visually. You should be used to the Wix editor by now (remedy this ASAP if not) so that you can make pages look the way you want. ASK IN CLASS IF YOU CAN'T; there is a 0% chance you are the only person with that question.
- Don't be ridiculous with the length of your captions (ie don't write full paragraphs and pretend it's OK).
- Reflect critically on what you're doing using course readings. This is not optional---the point of the readings is that you can use them!


## Essay Requirements
- **Citations** are the primary indication of the breadth and depth of your research. You should have at least 5 original historical sources and 5 secondary sources. You should have more, but if you don't have at least 5, I'm not even going to bother grading it.
- **Engaging storytelling**, with minimal use of passive voice.
- **Images with descriptive captions**. Use images not merely as eye candy, but to visually communicate the main points of your story.
- **Meaningful headings** that provide clear structure and communicate main topics.

## Citations
For inline citations, we will use author date notation (Smith 1975, 13). **Cite the most trusted original historical source that you can.** Keep in mind that "publications" like webpages are not trustworthy. But you can use them to help you identify useful sources.

Be as specific and consistent as you can with your citations, even though some of your historical sources may require some improvising.

## Sources
At the end of your essay, you should list the full bibliographic entry for your source to complement the inline citations that appear in the text. Use a second-level heading that says "Sources" (with no colon) at the top of this section.

## Image Credits
Provide descriptive phrases for your captions. As with your (limited) text, you must provide detailed citations to your image sources. As a class exercise, we are operating under the doctrine of fair use, so we don't need to worry about copyright for our website. Still, we should always be respectful of the fact that every image is a creative work subject to copyright.

## Section Headings
Do not use **bold** in your headings; use an appropriate heading level (as shown below). We can create new styles if need be. For your reference, all the headings styles are demonstrated below. Remember that you must have a space between the ### and the actual heading!

## Grading
- 0-2: Technically the assignment is done, but doesn't tell a cohesive story, has very limited images, or clearly rushed writing.
- 3-5: Displays a respectable level of effort, but generally underwhelming.
- 6-8: Shows potential, but falls short in scope or execution. Usually this score represents a solid effort but that is missing a critical component or is sloppily done. For instance, you might have way too much text, or not connect the images together very well with your text, or not have enough images to convey a useful history.
- 9-10: Carefully written; pulls in different readings from the course to analyze your experience (across all relevant readings from the syllabus); shows significant critical engagement with the assignment in that all description is used to make a broader point.
