## 2: The Uses of (Digital) History

### Tuesday (Jan 22)
- Beverley Southgate, _What is History For?_, 10-30.

### Thursday (Jan 24)
- Refine your ideas for our _Histories of New Mexico_ Project. Remember that it's easy to think of cool projects that end up being impossible because we can't find historical sources. So make sure what you want to focus on has at least some trace in available archives. Hunting for digital (and analog) sources is part of the fun! (ok, no, it's not always fun, but it's a necessary step in the process.)
  - [New Mexico Digital Collections](econtent.unm.edu)
  - [Rocky Mountain Online Archive](https://rmoa.unm.edu/)
  - For a huge range of digital content, see [this guide](https://libguides.unm.edu/az.php?t=6969=)

## 4: From Analog to Digital Archives

### Tuesday (Feb 5)
- Jefferson Bailey, [Disrespect Des Fonds: Rethinking Arrangement and Description in Born-Digital Archives](http://dev.archivejournal.net/?p=4722)

#### TO-DO
- Come to class ready to discuss your experience with some of the interfaces mentioned, or others that you've used for something that you've found interesting.
- Continue to look for sources for your research essay. We'll be talking more about that on in class and we will be more productive and efficient if you've more some poking around ahead of time.



#### EXTRA CREDIT OPTION
As discussed in class on Jan 31, this is our first extra credit possibility to give you a few extra points in the class. **This can be done at any point, not just for today** The assignment:
- Search for a history book at https://unm.worldcat.org/ or https://library.unm.edu/, that is also held physically in one of our libraries at UNM, and note what you see in the first few pages of search results for that book.
- Note the library call number for the book, and go find it in the stacks.
- Browse around the book and note what kind of books are physically around it---look at a few shelves above and below, too, not just the few books on either side of your target book.
- Write up a standard reading response blog post (~350 words) about how these two different browsing experiences compare.
- Obviously there's no right or wrong answer. But strive for clarity in your description of what you searched for, what you found in both cases, and how you might explain the differences.
- Responses will be scored as all others, namely on a 0-2 point scale.

The last few days have nothing scheduled because we'll probably be behind with individual and class projects, so a little buffer will help us get caught up as the semester concludes. And if we're not behind, maybe we don't need to meet anymore. But don't get your hopes up.

### Tuesday (Apr 30)
