## 2: The Uses of (Digital) History

### Tuesday (Jan 22)
- Beverley Southgate, _What is History For?_, 10-30.

### Thursday (Jan 24)
- Refine your ideas for our _Histories of New Mexico_ Project. Remember that it's easy to think of cool projects that end up being impossible because we can't find historical sources. So make sure what you want to focus on has at least some trace in available archives. Hunting for digital (and analog) sources is part of the fun! (ok, no, it's not always fun, but it's a necessary step in the process.)
  - [New Mexico Digital Collections](econtent.unm.edu)
  - [Rocky Mountain Online Archive](https://rmoa.unm.edu/)
  - For a huge range of digital content, see [this guide](https://libguides.unm.edu/az.php?t=6969=)

If you can't find at least three relatively easily, you might have trouble completing the project. So this is a good litmus test as to the viability of your idea.



## 4: From Analog to Digital Archives

### Tuesday (Feb 5)
- Jefferson Bailey, [Disrespect Des Fonds: Rethinking Arrangement and Description in Born-Digital Archives](http://dev.archivejournal.net/?p=4722)


#### TO-DO

#### TO-DO
- Come to class ready to discuss your experience with some of the interfaces mentioned, or others that you've used for something that you've found interesting.
- Continue to look for sources for your research essay. We'll be talking more about that on in class and we will be more productive and efficient if you've more some poking around ahead of time.



#### EXTRA CREDIT OPTION
As discussed in class on Jan 31, this is our first extra credit possibility. **This can be done at any point, not just for today** The assignment:
- Search for a history book at https://unm.worldcat.org/ or https://library.unm.edu/, that is also held physically in one of our libraries at UNM, and note what you see in the first few pages of search results for that book.
- Note the library call number for the book, and go find it in the stacks.
- Browse around the book and note what kind of books are physically around it---look at a few shelves above and below, too, not just the few books on either side of your target book.
- Write up a standard essay (like transcription assignment) (~800 words) about how these two different browsing experiences compare.
- Obviously there's no right or wrong answer. But strive for clarity in your description of what you searched for, what you found in both cases, and how you might explain the differences.
- Graded on 0-10 point scale, like everything but reading responses.

## 11: Intersectionality: Race, Class, and Gender

### Tuesday (Mar 26)
We didn't quite get to these last time, so it's our top priority for today. Should only take 20 minutes or so, but we can be more efficient in you've browsed the exercise guidelines ahead of time. As with all exercises, these are optional, but also opportunities for easy points.
- Discussion of assignments, recommended due dates, and scoring updates
- Discussion of [geo-referencing exercise](georeferencing-guidelines)

### Thursday (Mar 28)
- Discussion of collaborative **20 point** [UNM spatial history project](unm-spatial-history-guidelines)
  - Before class, read the [UNM Spatial History Guidelines](unm-spatial-history-guidelines).
  - Remember this is a spatial history, not just a building history. For instance, keep in mind how sources like this [Co-Ed Code](https://digitalrepository.unm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1006&context=unm_coed_code) can help you.

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Choose your place' text="
- Before class, pick a building or space on campus. Buildings that no longer exist have important spatial histories, too! Take a few minutes to find something that interests you.
- You can consult this [list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_University_of_New_Mexico_buildings) to get started, but you can do anything you want as long as no one else has claimed it.
- Add your name (in the author column) and building/place (in the place-name column) to our [UNM Campus History Index](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AE1X-dDphqyYjVlUj1w0xvWivnu0e7EtyxzuGNjbock/edit?usp=sharing)
  - Ignore all the other columns for now
  - Note that the data on this page will be used on our collaborative website, take care with details!
"%}


- Americo Paredes, _The Hammon and the Beans and Other Stories_ (Houston, TX: Arte Publico Press, 1994), 3-9.
  - How does intersectionality affect how space is conceived or structured? In other words, how is space modified by race, class, and gender? When reading Paredes think about what the landscape tells us about these positionalities. Who moves between the different spaces in the short story, who determines the spacial boundaries and their markers?  What can be read in this movement? As White states in What is Spatial History? (week 9!)  we "produce and reproduce space through our movements and the movements of goods..." and I would add the movement of  ideologies  as well.

## 12: Historical Authorities of Knowledge + Collaboration

### Tuesday (Apr 2)
{% include alert.html class='warning' title='Recommended Due Date' text="
Recommended first draft of your [geo-referencing exercise](georeferencing-guidelines)
"%}


Today's class will be split into two halves; the first part a discussion of History and Wikipedia, the second a discussion about the technology required for our collaborative spatial history project.

If you miss class you will create a lot of confusion for yourself and waste time. What we're doing cannot be explained effectively via email, and I will not teach this class again to you personally during office hours---so you need to be in class. We will be using these tools for our spatial history project and there is no alternative. Of course I will help you with problems, but you need to see the explanation in person first.


#### PART ONE
- Roy Rosenzwieg, "Can History Be Open Source? Wikipedia and the Future of the Past." _Journal of American History_ 93.1 (2006): 117-146.

#### PART TWO
Peruse these beforehand:
- Introduction to [Markdown](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/)
  - For later reference, there's an easy [cheat sheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).
- Introduction to [GitHub](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/). Read through this tutorial, but do not actually do all the steps---just try to understand what's going on and we'll go over it.

{% include alert.html class='info' title='Do in class or ASAP afterward' text="
- As with all our other tools, we're using real world tools as part of our survey of digital interfaces to history.
- Create a free and secure account at [GitHub](http://github.com). You can pick any username/password you want---it's independent of UNM and Zotero.
- Add your GitHub username to our [shared Google Doc of GitHub usernames](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Egg3c8LxeUo54B63HqbC-d-MSWKClvjJVfhrzxwz_YI/edit?usp=sharing) by the end of the day, and I'll invite everyone to join our GitHub Team. Like Zotero, You'll get an email asking if you want to accept the invitation. Do it!
- Use either [Dillinger](https://dillinger.io/) or a text editor (like [Atom](https://atom.io)) to create a plaintext Markdown file with some dummy text that includes some Markdown formatting---this shows me you understand the basics of Markdown. Be sure to save it as `firstname-lastname.md` (example: `fred-gibbs.md`). The text in your file doesn't matter, but make sure your filename:
  - has no spaces
  - is all lower case
  - ends with `.md`
- Be sure you are logged into GitHub, then add your Markdown file to [our GitHub repository](https://github.com/unm-campus-histories/spaces). To do this, click on the `testfiles` folder, or simply click [HERE](https://github.com/unm-campus-histories/spaces/tree/master/testfiles) then drag and drop your file onto your browser window. You should see my own test file there, `fred-gibbs.md`. If you don't see my file, you're in the wrong place!
- Click the green 'Commit Changes' button near the bottom of the page.
"%}


### Thursday (Apr 4)
{% include alert.html class='danger' title='GitHub Test' text="
Make sure your Markdown file is in the `testfiles` [folder](https://github.com/unm-campus-histories/spaces/tree/master/testfiles)!
"%}

Pick one of these two and be ready to discuss:

- IN CLASS: Solve GitHub and Markdown problems


## 13: Digital Public History

### Tuesday (Apr 9)
These are short, easy, and important, so you should read both. If you do a reading response for today, you should discuss both!
- Sheila Brennan, [Public, First](http://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/debates/text/83), in _Debates in the Digital Humanities_ (2016).
- Trevor Owens and Jesse Johnston, [Archivists as Peers in Digital Public History](https://osf.io/preprints/lissa/4hvtb/).
- Review assignment steps for Thursday.

### Thursday (Apr 11)
{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Image Test' text='
- Building off our testfiles exercise: for today, put a sample Markdown file for your UNM space (with appropriate file name) in our repository. We're not using the `testfiles` folder anymore, but rather our [essays folder in the docs folder](https://github.com/unm-campus-histories/spaces/tree/master/docs/essays). In this folder you'll see an `images` directory and my `mesa-vista-hall.md` sample file.
- You don't have to have done any research---you can simply use the text from [my sample file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/unm-campus-histories/spaces/master/docs/essays/mesa-vista-hall.md). Simply copy and paste this text into your editor---including the info at the very top--- save it as a text file, and drag and drop it into the essays folder, as you did in the previous exercise.
- PRO TIP: You can also create a file directly on GitHub by using the "Create New File" button, and copying and pasting text into the editor window. Remember to hit the green "Commit Changes" button.
- Your final essays will have lots of images in them, so we want to be sure everyone can display images in your place holder file.
- Find a test image to use (it doesn't have to be related to your campus space for this exercise) and download it to your computer. Rename the file according to our naming conventions (all lower case and dashes instead of spaces). The name should help you remember what the image is (keep in mind you'll have lots of images to keep track of eventually).
- To display images, we need them in our repository. You can add images as you have created files. Navigate to the the [images folder](https://github.com/unm-campus-histories/spaces/tree/master/docs/essays/images) and either drag and drop a single file, or select bunch and drag them all at once(much easier!).
- You need to make sure the block of code that loads the image is customized to your image by changing the `caption` and `source` fields, but the `source` field must always start with `images/`
- If you use my sample, change `src="images/default.jpg"` to `src="images/YOUR-IMAGE-FILENAME.EXT"` but replace `YOUR-IMAGE-FILENAME.EXT` with the name of your image file.
- IMPORTANT: The filename in the quotes and the name of your image file MUST MATCH EXACTLY (see the yellow box below), including the extension. My sample image file uses `.jpg` but yours might be different (.jpeg, or .png or .JPG, etc)
- Notice that the GitHub page for your file (like [the Mesa Visa one](https://github.com/unm-campus-histories/spaces/blob/master/docs/essays/mesa-vista-hall.md)) makes your Markdown look nice (with headers and bold and so on) but doesn't display images.
- To see if your images are working, go to your live webpage, which is at a URL like `https://unm-campus-histories.github.io/spaces/essays/mesa-vista-hall` except you need to replace `mesa-vista-hall` with the name of your file. We will have an easier way of doing that soon.
- Your webpage can take up to ten minutes to refresh when you make changes--usually just one or two minutes, but please be patient. Save yourself frustration by BEING CAREFUL with punctuation, ESPECIALLY WHEN CUTTING AND PASTING.
- For reference, consult the [THE CODE SAMPLES PAGE](https://unm-campus-histories.github.io/spaces/code)!

{% include alert.html class='warning' title='Image problems?' text="
If your image isn't showing up, there is 95% chance you referencing the wrong filename or folder. And a 5% chance you haven't put files in the right place.
- check the file extension (.jpg, .jpeg, .JPG, .png)
- check capitalization (mesa-vista is NOT THE SAME as Mesa-Vista)
- check for spaces and dashes (mesa-vista is NOT THE SAME as mesa vista)
- make sure your image file is where it is supposed to be, in `docs/essays/images`.
- make sure your place file is in the `docs/essays` folder, and the image path in your code starts with `images\`

Complete a solid draft of your [data interface critique](data-interface-critique).

The below article was originally scheduled for this week but is now optional. The exercise was going to be think through how it relates to the class, even though it doesn't have any explicit connection to digital history (so that's a good reading response topic if you do one).
