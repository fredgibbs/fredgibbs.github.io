* Add your custom CSS file to the css directory, with some CSS code in it that will change the typography of your essay (for instance, making the headers red as the gibbs.css file does).

## 13: Reviews

### Tuesday (Nov 14)
{% include alert.html class='danger' title='DUE: Last Updates' text="
* Make sure your essays looks and reads exactly as you want, **and as I want**. This will make peer review more useful for both authors and reviewers. Review the [Peer Critique Guidelines](peer-critique-guidelines)!
* IMAGES: You may find that you want to resize, rotate, or crop your images to improve the layout of your essay. While you can control the width easily already, sometimes a bit more editing would go a long way. Use either [Fotor](https://www.fotor.com/) or [Pixlr](https://pixlr.com/express/). Both are online, free, and straightforward image editing tools that you can figure out with a few minutes of playing around. They both do color correction, filtering, and effects, but mostly you'll just want to crop, rotate, or resize images---which are super easy to do---and then download a new version of your file. You can't edit your image on GitHub directly; you'll have to upload a new version.
"%}
* More screencasting


### Thursday (Nov 16)

## 16: Loose ends

### Dec 5
{% include alert.html class='warning' title='Optional Class' text="
Today is optional; we'll spend more time critiquing essays and videos for those who want extra feedback. While priority will be given to those who have not had their work critiqued in class thus far, everyone will leave with clearer ideas about how to revise their work before submitting final versions.
"%}

### Dec 7
The last chance for me to convince you that everything we did was seriously worth it. Also, evaluations and final advice for the assignments.
