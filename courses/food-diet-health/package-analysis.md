# Package Analysis Writing Guide

## Executive Summary
  - Pick a food/food-like item that makes health claims on its package. Cereal boxes, granola bars, various snack items, frozen dinners, supplements, and similar are usually good. DO NOT pick candy or soda or any product whose label doesn't have anything to do with health. Ask if you're not sure!
  - Write a 800-word analysis about how the package informs our perceptions of "healthy"
  - Your analysis must draw from course readings!


## Your Assignment
Your challenge is to critically analyze the package of some food OR supplement that makes some health-related claims. You should avoid products primarily marketed as fun, rather than healthy (like candy, soda, Doritos, etc). Some things like kids cereal straddle that line, but as long as there are health claims to critique, it's fine. If you can't automatically think of something to write about when you see the package, you should pick something else.


## Assignment Goals
This assignment shows that you’re able to apply the course discussion and activities in the real world by critically analyzing "stuff" that communicates about health, which is clearly true for most of the packages we see in grocery stores. **This is the goal of the entire course---see the learning objectives on the syllabus!---to help you think carefully and historically about diet and health.** In terms of the writing itself, the assignments encourage/force you to focus on the clarity and concision of your thinking and expression. It's a super useful skill that you'll frequently employ in your future career, whatever it is.


## Words
Your essay should be right around 800 words. This restrictive format is very deliberate, to force you to focus on quality over quantity. The challenge isn't to write 800 words, but pack as much analysis into that space as you can, and to make your writing as concise and clear as possible.


## Some advice (regardless of format)
The main question we're focusing on for this assignment: **How does your product's package shape our perception of health?**

Another question to keep in mind as you write: **How can the history of diet and health (as we've discussed it so far), provide any insight into why the package looks like it does?** For instance, you might discuss _how fear motivates health claims commonly seen on packages_.

You should begin your essay with a **quick description** of the product and package---no more than a few sentences---so that your readers have an idea of what you're writing about.



## References and Citations
One of the major goals of this assignment is to show me that you're doing the reading, and you will do this by deliberately drawing from the readings in your analysis. Do you see any distinct similarities or differences between expertise from our earlier readings? You should cite passages from the readings with author-date notation.

An example: _Although Cheyne appealed to his personal experience with diet, he himself was extraordinarily large (Shapin, 276)._

Please do not cite work from outside course readings---this assignment is to help me evaluate your engagement with our course materials.

## Formatting Checklist
- 12 pt. Times New Roman (or very similar serif font)
- 1" margins on all sides
- Your name and URL or citation to source at top
- Double spaced!

**NOTE: If your essay does not meet minimum formatting requirements, I will return it to you, and you will have to fix it, turn it in again, and you will lose points for being annoying.**


## Tips for success
 - **Be specific.** Never, even mention only that something relates to something else. You must explain how and why and the significance of the relationship. This is probably the biggest weakness with most essays. Don't say "This advice is like what Galen said." Give more details about how (and how much) such a claim is true, cite relevant passages from Galen (and/or readings about him), and why your comparison matters.
 - **Provide specific citations.** You need to cite page numbers! This forces you to double check your own memory and interpretation of the readings, and helps you avoid making false claims.
 - **Don't be banal.** Avoid trivial statements that are simply fluff and don't show you engaging with the course materials or your source.
 - **Paraphase.** Avoid long quotations in your critique, since you want use all the space for your own thinking and expression
 - **Be selective.** You can’t fit everything worth saying into your essay. Choose carefully what you think is most important!
 - **Revise, revise, revise.** Once you have a complete draft of everything you want to say, you are about 50% done. Set it aside (and budget time for this!), then come back and economize your prose. Remove simple sentences that force you to be unnecessarily verbose.

 In the process of getting your ideas on paper, you might end up with something like: "This article does not cite any research. The lack of research means it is difficult to understand if it should be trusted."

 During revisions, you should rephrase this to: "The article's lack of citations compromises its authority and casts out on its validity."

 This kind of revision gives you much-needed space for more analysis and makes your writing (and you, by extension) smarter.

**NOTE: Revisions are hard!** But they are the only way to make your writing shine.


## Resubmissions
If you are not pleased with your grade, you can revise and resubmit them within **1 week** of getting them back. You get an average grade between the two, though I tend to count the second one a bit more. I encourage you to meet with me about your essay before revising it to make sure you have a clear understanding how to improve it.
