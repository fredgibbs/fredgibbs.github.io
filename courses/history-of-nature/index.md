## Course Description
It's easy to take supermarkets for granted. Why shouldn't they abound with vibrant and uniform vegetables, tasty snacks, and highly perishable but perfectly safe meat and dairy products. But the seeming inevitability of our grocery stores obscures the complex and frequently surprising history of the intersection of food and technology. Carefully considering the inevitable tension between our desire for pure, natural food and our desire for cheap, convenient, and consistent food gives us a better understanding of not only our changing relationship to food, but also technology in general.


## Student Learning Outcomes
- Articulate the history of the US food system and its relationship with technological developments
- Think broadly and critically about how food is produced and how technological improvements have altered food systems and our relationship to food
- Articulate clear arguments about the intersection of agriculture, consumerism, environmental and population health
- Understand modern technological developments with respect to food in historical context
- Critically evaluate argument and evidence in any food-related writing


## Readings & Assignments
Note at the top of the page, the link to the schedule page of the syllabus: [http://fredgibbs.net/courses/food-technology-society/schedule.html](http://fredgibbs.net/courses/food-technology-society/schedule.html).

Please note that the schedule is a living document and changes depending on what's going on in the course. If you print it out, you'll need to keep your paper version up to date with the online version. If you keep a browser tab open all semester, make sure you refresh it when you go to look up the next assignment and reflection prompt.

To access all other articles and book chapters on the syllabus, we use a tool called Zotero to manage and provide access to articles and chapter scans. All readings that aren't already online (and some that are) will be available through the class Zotero library.


## Connecting to Zotero

### Step 1: Create a Zotero account
If you don't have one already, [sign up for a free account at zotero.org](https://www.zotero.org/user/register). Creating a Zotero account requires only that you specify a username, password, and email address. You will not get any spam from Zotero or anyone else because of your Zotero account. **Use your UNM email address!**

### Step 2: Make sure you are logged in at zotero.org
You should see your username or a "Log Out" link on the top nav bar. If you see a "Log In" link, you need to log in. Pretty straightforward.

### Step 3: Request to Join our group library
Once you know you are logged in to zotero.org, visit [our Zotero Group homepage](https://www.zotero.org/groups/1647225/food-tech-society-unm/), and click the red "Join" button off to the right, which will send an email to me. As soon as I see it (usually within the hour unless you're doing this late at night), I'll approve your request to join the group. There is nothing else you need to do at this point.

Once you've completed the steps above, and I've approved your request to join our library, you can access our course readings most easily via [our Group Library page](https://www.zotero.org/groups/1647225/food-tech-society-unm/library). Double clicking an item brings up a PDF of the article or chapter.

## Work Requirements and Grading
- Thorough preparedness and engaged participation in most every class meeting. This course is focused on cultivating different perspectives about how we can think about food, technology, and society---not just memorizing and regurgitating supposedly important "facts"---so you need to be in the conversation. (20%)

- One ~1200-word [book review](book-review-guide). This is a chance for you to apply the course to understanding a book related to food and technology, as I hope you will continue to do after the course is over. (15%)

- One ~800-word [Old newspaper ad analysis](newspaper-ads-guide) (10%)

- Four 2-page [executive summaries](exec-summary-guide) of class readings (5% each points each; 20% total)

- One ~1200-word [website analysis](website-analysis-guide) on GMO safety (10%)

- One ~2400-word final essay
  - See the [final essay guide](final-essay-guide) for more details. (25%)


### Submission Policies
Late work is not accepted unless due to a medical issue or other extenuating circumstances. You should let me know about these ASAP and let me know when you can get caught up.

### Please Ask for Help
Please please please come talk me at any time. I'm alway happy to tell you how I think you're doing in the class and how it can be improved (if at all).

If life gets overwhelming during the course, it can be tempting to drift away from an elective course like this. Rather than disappear, please come talk with me about how we can accommodate your circumstances and thus avoid digging a huge hole from which it becomes increasingly difficult to escape.


## Extra Credit
There are roughly a zillion books, articles, websites, documentaries, films, etc about food + technology. Most are not very good. As in a total-waste-of-time kind of way. But films/documentaries about food are usually more interesting than most other stuff because of the production costs involved. This does not guarantee quality, of course (surely you've seen something about food that just wasn't worth it), but the genre provides a useful filter against mindless blog posts created simply because someone needs more "content" and places for ads.

So, if you would like (and who wouldn't) to write a film/documentary review of anything related to the relationship between food and technology, you should do that for extra credit. Reviews should be ~900 words (which is insanely short for a balanced and thoughtful review). They can be worth, depending on the quality, up to 4 extra credit points.

Your review has two main tasks that each should comprise roughly half of your review: (1) to provide an overview of the film; (2) to critically evaluate its strengths and weaknesses in light of the course. Your review MUST use class readings and discussions! Imagine yourself taking on the role of expert reviewer, helping your reader (not just me) decide if the film is worth their time.

You don't have to ask me if something is appropriate. You need to EXPLAIN to me in your review how it's appropriate and how we should evaluate it in light of the course. Not to be too cavalier about points, but a serious effort will probably get you at least 2 points.


### Extra credit is EXTRA, not substitute.
You can only get extra credit points if you have turned in all other assigned work.
