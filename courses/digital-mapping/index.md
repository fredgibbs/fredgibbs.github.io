# Course Description
We are in the midst of a major paradigm shift in human consciousness and society caused by our ubiquitous connectedness via the internet and smartphones. These globalizing forces have telescoped space and time to an unprecedented degree, while paradoxically heightening the importance of local places.

The course explores the technologies, tools, and workflows that can help collect, connect, and present online interpretations of the spaces around us. Throughout the week, we'll discuss the **theoretical and practical challenges of deep mapping** (producing rich, interactive maps with multiple layers of information). Woven into our discussions will be numerous technical tutorials that will allow us to tell map-based stories about Albuquerque's fascinating past.

-----
This course combines cartography, geography, GIS, history, sociology, ethnography, computer science, and graphic design. While we cover some of the basics of each of these, the course eschews developing deep expertise in any of these in favor of exploring their intersections with each other, and formulating critical questions that span these normally disconnected disciplines. By the end, you should be able to think more critically about maps, place, and our online experiences with them.  

----

<br>
We'll move from creating simple maps with **Google Maps/Earth** to creating your own custom, **interactive online maps** with various open source tools like **QGIS**, **Open Street Map**, and **D3** that leverage the power of **open data** from local and national repositories to provide new perspectives on the built environment. We'll also use various **mobile apps for data collection**, **online exhibit software**, (physical and digital) **historical archives** at the Center for Southwest Research. Along the way we'll cover the various **data formats** (KML, XML, GeoJSON, TopoJSON) used by different tools and how to move between them, allowing you to craft the most efficient workflow for your mapping purposes.

Course readings that aren't freely availabe online (and even some that are) can be accessed via the course [Zotero Library](https://www.zotero.org/groups/267332/items/order/creator/sort/asc). You'll need to be invited to join the group since we use it to distribute course readings. If you are not familiar with Zotero, here are [some instructions](/courses/etc/zotero.html).

# Course Objectives

- Appreciate the theoretical possibilities and practical limitations of deep digital mapping.

- Understand the principles of new media, linked open data, and interface design as applies to the geospatial humanities.

- Combine qualitative and quantitative analytical skills

- Begin to experiment with new tools, workflows, methods, and techniques for mapping the urban environment, including QGIS, Omeka + Neatline, Google Maps/Earth, basic web mapping concepts, basic web programming, Javascript, SVG, D3.

- Develop awareness and conversational fluency in geographic data formats, technologies, and tools so that you can produce maps and troubleshoot new challenges on your own.

- Must be able to have fun while totally frustrated, even when this stupid little thing takes way longer than it should.

- GRADUATE STUDENTS: In addition to all other activities on the syllabus, you'll also take turns leading discussion of reading topics.

- EVERYONE: The key to success with the technical components of this course (both learning-wise and grade-wise) is to make mistakes and fail as frequently as possible. If you're not, then you're simply not trying to push beyond your own limitations. Once you fail at something, we'll get you unstuck and moving forward again. Repeating this often will make the course more rewarding and you'll get a high grade for your effort.

## Planning Our ABQ Map Project
We'll work together to create a richly layered interactive map that displays, contextualizes, and historicizes some features of ABQ. The particular topic (if there is a general theme) can be just about anything as long as it has a spatial and historical component. The goal is to create a new kind of spatial interface to understanding the space around us. Ideally, our individual contributions will present different views or facets of ABQ that are displayed spatially and thoroughly contextualized.

- What should the modern walking tour look like? (i.e. how to explore the past and present of the built environment?)?  
- How might we extend the photography work from the "Photographing the Build Environment" course?  
- Can we build a better version of an [existing city map](http://www.cabq.gov/gis/map-views/mobile-maps)?  
- Tell a story about ABQ murals, graffiti, empty lots, displaced shopping carts, street gradients, etc.  
- Can we tell a stories about not just [historic places](http://www.cabq.gov/planning/our-department/urban-design-and-development/historic-landmarks) but historic spaces? (ie the context of these historic landmarks?)  
- How we can chart the development of the Highland neighborhood over time? (expanding the historical dimension of the [redevelopment plan](etc/Nobhill-Highland-Redevelopment-2007.pdf))

## Overlaying Historic Maps
[Overview of Georeferencing Historic Maps](http://www.dlib.org/dlib/november12/fleet/11fleet.html)

### Historic Map Sources
[Perry-Castañeda Library Map Collection](http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/) and their list of [Historic Maps](http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/map_sites/hist_sites.html)

[Old Maps Online](http://www.oldmapsonline.org/)  
[Broer Map Library](http://broermapsonline.org/site/)


## LAB: put your (historic) data on a historic map
- Download historic map  
- Georectify the image in QGIS  
- Create new vector layers from historic map overlay
- View some (historic) data several vector layers on the map   

## Mapping Uncertainty
- Peter Fisher and Jo Wood, [What is a Mountain? Or The Englishman who went up a Boolean Geographical Concept but Realised it was Fuzzy](http://www.jstor.org/stable/pdfplus/40573211.pdf?acceptTC=true).  
- Johanna Drucker, [Humanities Approaches to Graphical Display](http://digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/5/1/000091/000091.html).  
- Anne-Kathrin Reuschel and Lorenz Hurni, “Mapping Literature: Visualisation of Spatial Uncertainty in Fiction,” 293-308.  

## Web Mapping Basics
We'll cover how to create your own interactive maps online. Why? Because you can add much more custom interactivity than generic tools and services allow. This is an exercise in design imagination.

- Read UP TO the JAVASCRIPT section in [Interactive Data Visualization for the Web](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1230000000345/ch03.html) (when the page loads, you awkwardly end up in the middle of it...scroll up to the top to begin reading).  

### Creating Your Own Web Maps
- Install [MAMP](http://www.mamp.info/en/downloads/) (Mac) or [WAMP](http://www.wampserver.com/en/) (Windows) so you can make webpages on your own computer  
- Make a simple webpage that follows the example   
- Add a simple Google map [using these instructions](https://developers.google.com/maps/tutorials/fundamentals/adding-a-google-map).  
- Go through the 4 other tutorials on that page, including "Displaying KML," but using the KML file that you created and exported from the earlier Google exercise.  

### Alternatives to Google
There are some reasons one might not want to use Google Maps for your web mapping needs:

- don’t want to be beholden to their terms of service  
- you prefer to use open source rather than proprietary tools and data  
- you're site will go viral and you'll exceed your request limit  
- various copyright and privacy issues  
- they look like Google maps and you want something more unique  

#### Several excellent alternatives:  
[OpenLayers](http://openlayers.org/)  
[Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/examples/quick-start.html)

No matter what library you use for putting a map on your webpage, you can get map tiles from several sources, including [Stamen Maps](http://maps.stamen.com/#watercolor/11/35.1000/-106.5100).

[MapBox](https://www.mapbox.com/) helps you link your own data and provides an online style editor for customizing the look of your map. For more flexibility, use a desktop editor called [TileMill](https://www.mapbox.com/tilemill/).

### LAB: Creating your own tiled maps
Walk through the [tutorial](https://www.mapbox.com/tilemill/docs/crashcourse/introduction/) for uploading your data, facilitating custom interactivity. Essentially, this tool allows you to create your own tiles that you can publish on Mapbox.com (a free account gives you limited space, of course), and you can load these onto any web page.
