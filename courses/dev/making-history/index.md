## Course Description and Goals
This course is designed to introduce students to the discipline of history. It will help students understand historical thinking which include chronological thinking, historical comprehension, historical analysis and interpretation, historical research capabilities, and historical issues analysis and decision-making.

The core philosophy underlying the course is that the study of history is essential for the educated citizen. Students will consider the difference between history and memory, how history has been used in the past to manipulate public memory, and how the study of history has been at the center of recent culture wars. Through readings and class discussion students will explore the nature of the study of history and consider the place of history in their everyday lives.


## Student Learning Outcomes (SLOs)
Through readings, lectures, discussions, examinations, as well as writing assignments, students, upon completion of this course, will be able to:
1. Students will be able to EXPLAIN in their work how humans in the past shaped their own unique historical moments, constructed historical memories, and were shaped by those moments and memories over time.

2. Students will DISTINGUISH between primary and secondary sources, IDENTIFY and EVALUATE evidence and UNDERSTAND people in their historical context.

3. Students will SUMMARIZE and APPRAISE the diversity of historical experiences, interpretations, evidence in order to RECONSTRUCT past events and EVALUATE how history and historical memory can be used and misused for various purposes.

4. Students will IDENTIFY historical arguments in a variety of sources and EXPLAIN how they were constructed, EVALUATING credibility, perspective, and relevance.
