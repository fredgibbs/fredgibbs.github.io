#### TO-DO FOR NEXT CLASS
- Get started with this over the weekend and bring questions to class on Tuesday.
- Review the [assignment guidelines](transcription-guidelines). (summarized below, but important details are on the guidelines page)
- Review some [transcription tips](https://www.archives.gov/citizen-archivist/transcribe/tips).
- Pick one of the transcription projects above.
- Transcribe at least THREE pages (can be sequential pages of the same document).
- Create screen shots of your work, including images of what you're transcribing and aspects of the interface that you comment on.
- Create a NEW PAGE in your portfolio for your ~800-word essay--this is not a blog post like reading responses--that describes and critiques your experience.
- Imagine that you're writing for other students in the class (so you don't need to introduce what a transcription project is, for example). We all know the general assignment, but you can't assume anyone is familiar with your site, interface, text, or experience.

### Wed Oct 14
- Americo Paredes, _The Hammon and the Beans and Other Stories_ (Houston, TX: Arte Publico Press, 1994), 3-9.
  - How does intersectionality affect how space is conceived or structured? In other words, how is space modified by race, class, and gender? When reading Paredes think about what the landscape tells us about these positionalities. Who moves between the different spaces in the short story, who determines the spacial boundaries and their markers?  What can be read in this movement? As White states in What is Spatial History? (week 9!)  we "produce and reproduce space through our movements and the movements of goods..." and I would add the movement of ideologies as well.
