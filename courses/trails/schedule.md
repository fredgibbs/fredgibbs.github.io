## Week 2: The Challenge of Public History

### Monday, 8/27: The Heroic Trail
All of the following should be read for overall flavor---don't get bogged down in historical detail. You'll get some very interesting history of a few trails (and we'll read more recent stuff later), but more importantly we want to pay attention to the historiography here---the way these histories are written, which are representative of early trail histories (and much of western history) generally. We read (for last Wednesday) the Snead (et al.) chapter to get an overview of ways of thinking about trails; what kinds of assumptions do the authors make about trails? What are their analytical frameworks? Who or what are these histories about? Who are the actors? Who is left out? Whose story is this?

Some of these readings provide maps, but the cartographic representation of the trails is generally lacking. I encourage you to view the maps of the trails on the NPS-NTIR website to get a better geographical sense of where the trails go. How much does geography matter in these older histories for today?

### Wednesday, 8/29: Popularizing the Trail
Today we're reading more direct critiques of trail interpretation, about historic signage and about the Oregon Trail (1990) video game. While these critiques have their own specific targets, they raise numerous issues that apply to any interpretive effort regarding national trails, including books, signage, websites, mobile apps, etc. Therefore, we should keep these critiques in mind whenever we read anything about the trail. What implicit messages do interpretations send to readers?

#### Do all of these in order, please!

    - How would Winks analyze this game? Who is in the game? Who isn't? How does the game succeed and fail at popularizing history?

- Phil Edwards, "[The Bloody, Sexy, Drunken Oregon Trail](https://www.vox.com/2016/3/3/11152436/r-rated-oregon-trail)" (*Vox*, 3 March 2016).


### Friday, 8/31: Modern Meditations
Continuing our critiques of trail interpretation, and applying concerns from last time to more modern instances:
- Download and critique the [NPS Oregon Trail Mobile App](https://www.nps.gov/oreg/learn/photosmultimedia/mobile-tours-and-apps.htm).
- Look through and critique [Santa Fe Trail Association website](https://www.santafetrail.org/).

For an engaging philosophical approach to thinking about trails:
- Robert Moor, *On Trails: An Exploration* (London: Quarto, 2017), 161--202. [PDF](readings/on-trails.pdf)

- Building on our guest lecture from Frank Norris, skim through a few very short essays at the [50th Anniversary of the Trail System Blog](https://www.trails50.org/new-blog/) to get a sense of modern "administration" and interpreting the modern trail.



## Week 3: Firsthand accounts

### Monday, 9/3: LABOR DAY: NO CLASS

### Wednesday, 9/5: Original voices
Spend some time with each of the below selections. At least read the first few chapters of each---but I think/hope you'll find them kind of addictive and read if not skim a bit more. If you get bored, at least skip around through the books until you get to a section that captures your attention.  In class, we'll talk about how these both echo and diverge from what we've read for class so far. How would you characterize the tone of these books? What are the assumptions and cultural frameworks of the authors? To what extent is it possible to capture the richness of these experiences/accounts in modern trail interpretation and administration? Or maybe we should put them behind us and keep them out of view?

Beyond the first few chapters (as noted above), I have recommended some pages that provide a diverse set of descriptions, but should feel free to read just the beginnings of each or skip around randomly as well.

- Francis Parkman, *The Oregon Trail: Adventures on the Prairie in the 1840's* (Santa Barbara, Calif.: Narrative Press, 2001). [ProQuest](https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/unm/detail.action?docID=3375129#)
- Ezra Meeker, _Personal Experiences on the Oregon Trail Sixty Years Ago_ (St. Louis: McAdoo printing co., 1912), [Internet Archive](http://archive.org/details/personalexperien00meekrich) Read the beginning bits, but also skim through the whole thing---note all the monuments and places mentioned in the video game (esp starting after p. 46). How is the context different here? Can you imagine how the game would be different if not for Meeker's efforts?
- Josiah Gregg, *Commerce of the Prairies: Or, the Journal of a Santa Fé Trader, during Eight Expeditions across the Great Western Prairies, and a Residence of Nearly Nine Years in Northern Mexico* Vol. II, 5th ed.

What did you learn about commerce?
- James A. Little, _What I Saw on the Old Santa Fe Trail: A Condensed Story of Frontier Life Half a Century Ago_ (Plainfield, IN: Friends Press, 1904). [Google Books](https://books.google.com/books?id=03FNAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false) Recommended: All the random stuff before the table of contents; also, 11-38.
- Lewis H. Garrard, *Wah-to-Yah and the Taos Trail* (Cincinnati: H. W. Derby & Co., 1850). [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/wahtoyahtaostrai00garr) Recommended: 157-198.

###  Wednesday, 9/12: Deconstructing Maps
Today we're reading two classics on cartographic literacy. Come to class prepared to talk about what kinds concerns we should keep in mind when reading/evaluating/critiquing maps about National Historic Trails. How can we combine the concerns presented in the readings for Monday, today, and earlier stuff on public history?

- J. B. Harley, "Deconstructing the Map," *Cartographica* 26, no. 2 (1989): 1--20.
Note that Harley can veer into the philosophical weeds at times, but it's never for very long, so don't give up. On the whole, he makes a lot of very important points about reading and understanding maps that are stated very clearly.

## Week 5: Environmental + American history

### Monday, 9/17: Mythical and Natural Environments
- DUE: Map comparison
    - ~750 words, 12pt font, double-spaced, 1" margins
    - bring hard copies to class on Monday
    - pick 1 map to deeply analyze, or pick 2 to comparatively analyze, or pick 4 to broadly compare (picking 1 or 2 is what I would recommend, but I leave it up to you)
    - minimize description in favor of analysis according to map critique techniques discussed in readings and in class
    - in other words, explain the presumptions of the cartographers, hidden agendas, biases, etc (just as our readings for Wednesday foregrounded)
    - describe how what's left off of the map shapes our sense of reality
    - draw extensively from previous course readings---not only the space/map readings---and cite them like (Bodenhamer, 12).


Our readings for this week are meant to call into question the changing meaning of what seem like unalterable categories, like frontier, nature, or wilderness. First, skim the classic and still important Turner article (referenced in Cronon) and think about how what he describes gets reflected in histories of national historic trails. You're reading mostly for familiarity rather than deep knowledge, so read quickly. Focus your attention on Cronon's article and, again, think about how we can apply it to trails work generally.

### Friday, 9/28: NPS-NTIR Historical Vignettes Project
We'll discuss our first assignment from National Park Service---to write 3-5 page historical vignettes about significant people from the two Camino Real historic trails. Each person will write one vignette. More deadlines will be posted soon.

We've been given some examples, which you should read before class. We'll critique these together (along the lines of all the other critiques we've done together) to get clear about how we want to write our own vignettes. We have a distinct advantage of having read and discussed many historical accounts and perspectives about the trails. So, finally, we get to put all our critical reading into practice.

- IN CLASS: Time to use Zotero properly.

### Wednesday, 10/10: NO CLASS (PRE FALL BREAK)

### Friday, 10/12: NO CLASS (FALL BREAK)



## Week 9: Ends and Beginnings

### Monday, 10/15: Primary Sources: Women in their own words
Today we're practicing reading primary sources (trail diaries), which you will likely encounter and should use during your own research (if not for the vignettes then for the next project). You'll read one article that tries to make sense of Susan Magoffin's diary from the Santa Fe Trail in 1846. Then, you'll apply those techniques to interpreting the diary of Harriett Shaw, who traveled the SFT in 1851, who we also will read for Monday.  

First, read quickly through this article that very clearly describes how to interpret this kind of source. We've read some interesting descriptions of life on the trail, but nothing approaches the vibrancy of first-hand accounts. Don't worry about the details, but do appreciate how the author of the article is trying to read between the lines of the diary and extract larger meaning from the minutia recorded therein.

Next, Consult the diaries of Harriett Bidwell Shaw, available [here](https://www.kansasmemory.org/item/display.php?item_id=209694&f=00059118). Note the handwriting and how fun it would be to read it in the original. Luckily, someone has already done very useful transcription work for us, so to actually read the diary, click on the "text version" button. You don't need to read every entry, but the more the better. It's kind of fun! Read enough to get a sense of her worldview, and what her diary tells us about trail travel in the mid nineteenth century. Think of the map critique assignment and how you commented on what wasn't there as much as what was, and how seemingly trivial details can be very revealing. Please come to class ready to discuss how the diary can tell us something about the themes and categories that we've considered in class and, in general, what we can learn from Ms. Shaw.

Remember, we'll be writing about the Santa Fe Trail for our next and main research project. So both of these readings will be super helpful for establishing general context of the trail experience.

It's always a bit trying to restart after break, but we should have a fun discussion on Monday morning!

#### We have completed the required reading portion of the course!


### Wednesday, 10/17: FIRST DRAFTS
DUE: Bring a printed copy of your first draft to class for our first peer review session during class.

### Some more important research tools for your vignette projects:
- [Hathitrust](http://www.hahthitrust.org): lots of older books and government reports, complete with a useful full-text search tool
- [Archive.org](http://www.archive.org): specializes in multimedia, but some scans may be better quality than others
- [Rocky Mountain Online Archive](https://rmoa.unm.edu/): digitized photos, maps, and documents from libraries around the Southwest
- [New Mexico Digital Collections](https://econtent.unm.edu/): New Mexico-specific online archive with legal documents, diagrams, and historic newspapers
- [Google Books](https://books.google.com/): perfect for older sources that are now in the public domain

#### Important Tips for Success
- I say "first draft", but I mean first draft that is worth showing to someone else. This should be closer to 3rd or 4th draft. Quality over quantity.
- Every historical claim (or set of claims if they are closely related and from the same source), should have a citation like (AUTHOR-LAST-NAME, PAGE-NUMBER).
- Attach to your draft a complete bibliography. Complete means everything you've looked at to this point, but it may grow as you continue work on them.
- The better your draft, the better the final version, and the higher your grade. And the less aggravated I'll be, which is generally better for everyone.
- Even more than usual, it's SUPER annoying to deal with people who come in late. Highly discouraged.


### Friday, 10/19: SECOND DRAFTS
DUE: Your "second" draft that incorporates feedback from the peer review session and other improvements from general discussions. Bring a printed copy to class and you'll exchange with someone else (to critique them over the weekend) to get another set of eyes on your text.

- Quiz on earlier readings

#### DO NOT MISS CLASS!
Or you will create a lot of confusion for yourself and waste time trying to sort through it. What we're doing cannot be explained over email, and I will not teach this class again to you personally during office hours---so you need to be in class. We will be using these tools the rest of the semester, so you can't wait for them to go away.

Peruse these beforehand:
- Introduction to [Markdown](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/)
- Introduction to [GitHub](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/). Read through this tutorial, but do not actually do all the steps---just try to understand what's going on and we'll go over it.


#### As soon as possible after class
- Create a free and secure account at [GitHub](http://github.com). You can pick any username you want---it's independent from UNM and Zotero.
- Email Guy (gmcclell@unm.edu) your GitHub username. He'll invite you to join our GitHub "Team". Like Zotero, You'll get an email asking if you want to accept the invitation. Do it!
- Use either [Dillinger](https://dillinger.io/) or a text editor (like [Atom](https://atom.io)) to create a plaintext Markdown file with some dummy text that includes some Markdown formatting. Be sure to save it as `FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME.md`. The content of your markdown file is irrelevant, but be sure your filename has no spaces and ends with `.md`.
- Add that Markdown file to our  [repository](https://github.com/historic-trails/santa-fe-itinerary). Be sure you are logged into GitHub when you do this: Click on the `testfiles` folder, then drag and drop your file onto your browser window.
- If you are confused about Markdown, go back to our [Markdown tutorial](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/); for syntax help, consult the [cheat sheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)

## Week 12: Itinerary Drafts

### Monday, 11/05
- Lecture on the National Historic Registry


### Wednesday, 11/07
- READ selections an NPS [Santa Fe History](https://dnr.mo.gov/shpo/nps-nr/64500309.pdf). This is a a kind of historic registry nomination form that we've been looking at but intended to be for all historic sites near the Santa Fe Trail. It begins with a long and thorough history (with just under 800 footnotes), and also has a long bibliography that we'll want to keep an eye on. We're reading from section E (Statement of Historic Contexts), which starts on page 3 of the PDF, but is labeled as E1 on the document (yay bureaucracy!). All pages are as listed in the document, not what your PDF reader says.
  - Make sure you at least skim everything and read carefully what interests you. Some paragraphs have lots of detail to support a larger point; obviously we're not concerned with minute detail, but it helps indicate what we know and what we don't about the Trail. Read extra quickly over those bits.
  - Introduction (1-6)
  - Part I (13-38)
  - Part II (39-44)
  - Part III (44-47)
  - Part IV (57-middle 59)
  - Part V (62-top 67)

### Monday, 11/12
- DUE: ITINERARY OUTLINES
  - Note there is a sample outline [HERE](https://github.com/historic-trails/santa-fe-itinerary/blob/master/docs/sites/blue-mills.md)
    - This is very much, like your outlines, a work in progress, but notice:
      - the general topics are clear, distinct, and in a reasonable (not necessarily final) order
      - it's clear what i have sources for and what i need to research further
      - although clearly super rough, it's a solid base to build on and that's what you need to have by Monday.
  - Need to produce COMPLETE outline--the main work is in pulling out the main points from the registration forms and ordering it appropriately for a general audience.
  - Use 1-2 sentences (even if incomplete) that will ultimately become topic sentences of your paragraphs. They can be rough an sketchy now, but the ideas should be clear.
  - For each paragraph, have 2-3 sub-bullets (of things to mention, research etc)
  - Use specific citations; or note where more research is needed
  - Minimum 10 sources in Zotero collection (start with sources on registration forms).
  - Name your file according to your site like `blue-mills.md`
    - use dashes, NOT spaces
    - all lower case
    - `.md` extension
  - Add your file to the [new sites folder](https://github.com/historic-trails/santa-fe-itinerary/tree/master/docs/sites) in our repository
