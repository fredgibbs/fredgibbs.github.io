## Week 2: The Challenge of Public History

### Monday, 8/27: The Heroic Trail
All of the following should be read QUICKLY! You'll get some very interesting history of a few trails (and we'll read more recent stuff later on), but more importantly we want to pay attention to the historiography here---the way these histories are written, which are representative of early trail histories (and much of western history) generally. We read the Snead (et al.) chapter to get an overview of ways of thinking about trails; what kinds of assumptions do the authors make about trails? What are their analytical frameworks? Who or what are these histories about? Who are the actors? Who is left out? Whose story is this?

Some of these readings provide maps, but the cartographic representation of the trails is generally lacking. I encourage you to view the maps of the trails on the NPS-NTIR website to get a better geographical sense of where the trails go. How much does geography matter in these older histories for today?
