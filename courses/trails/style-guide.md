# Historic Site Style Guide
As Lane suggested, it will be very useful for you to have a style guide to make sure we're formatting our essays consistently. This is IN ADDITION to the [general rubric](http://fredgibbs.net/courses/trails/essay-grading-rubric.pdf).

Below I've tried to summarize what we've decided in class. **If I've missed anything, EDIT THIS DOCUMENT ON GITHUB.** You have the power.

## Quick Facts
- We voted that a Quick Facts section is OPTIONAL.
- If you'd like to add one, Aaron (aka Fort Marcy) has an excellent example of how to do a handsome Quick Facts section that models the NPS travel itinerary pages

## Headings
- The first thing on your page should be your site title in H1, like `# title` in Markdown.
- All subsequent headings should be in H2, like `## subheading`
- If you want to use a sub sub heading, great! (`### subsubheading`)
- All headings should use TITLE CASE, like "Mary had a Little Lamb"

## Horizontal Rules
- These should be kept to a minimum, within your essay but you can use them where you really want them
- BUT, do not use them around the heading or the top of the page
- DO put one at the very end of your essay, and between all subsequent sections (directions for visiting, address, etc)

### Related People, Places, Articles
- Headings should be in H5 (`#####`)
- Make sure your references are formatted as a list

## Bibliography
- Your bibliography should be the last thing on the pages.
- Use title (in H2) of "Bibliography"
- Make sure your references are formatted as a list
- We decided on CHICAGO style
- Make sure the references are unambiguous and as precise as possible
- Minimize ugly URLS on the page; make sure they are hyperlinked

## Unsure or confused?
- Look at other essays to get ideas of what other people are doing
- Decide how much you should do something similar or if you really need to do something else (and it's OK if you do)
- Essays don't have to match perfectly, but we should keep stylistic deviations to a minimum and for specific reasons other than laziness or ignorance.
