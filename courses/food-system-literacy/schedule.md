# IN PROGRESS!
This syllabus is a living document and changes frequently, depending on what's going on in the course. If you print it out, you'll need to keep your paper version up to date with the online version. I will always announce important changes in class.


## Introductions

### Aug 22
Today we'll review the syllabus, course aims, assignments, and general plan for the semester. We'll also figure out how to customize the course to best suit participants' interests.


### Aug 24
Two contrasting visions of food production:
* Melanie Warner, _Pandora's Lunchbox_, xiii-xix; 1-20 (Weird Science). This is a super quick read.
* James, E. McWilliams, _Revolution in Eating_, 240-64; 274-5. (A culinary declaration of independence). The PDF is in the Zotero library, or you can read it online [here](http://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/unm/detail.action?docID=895246). Skip the section "Defining American Food." On the whole, no need to labor over the details; focus on the forest, not the trees.


## Land and Capital

### Aug 29
* Lisi Krall, “Thomas Jefferson’s Agrarian Vision and the Changing Nature of Property,” 131–33; 144-48.
* William Cronon, _Nature's Metropolis_, 23-54. Although this reading is not specifically about food production, it introduces how we can understand westward expansion as systematic conversion of land to capital, as introduced by Krall.

### Aug 31
* William Cronon, _Nature's Metropolis_, 55-93 (mid 1830-60; Impact of rails on shipping)
* Discussion of review assignment due in 1 week (see below).

### Sep 7

* Harvey Levenstein, _Revolution at the Table_, 121-136 (Best for Babies, 1880-1930).

* FOR NEXT MEETING (9/19): Find food ads from around 1900 (1880-1920 at the extremes); What kinds of products are they promoting? What kinds of techniques do they use? What are they appealing to? How are they using science to sell food? Who are they marketing to?

FALL BREAK

For the next week, we're going to collaboratively tackle an advertising research project. We'll divide up into groups and focus on different years 1920-1970 (time span subject to adjustment), and how, from a food standpoint, those years appear in ABQ newspapers. We'll try to discover how how stores/businesses advertised food, and how this changed over time as the city grew dramatically. More detailed instructions and links will appear here as we get closer to the date.
