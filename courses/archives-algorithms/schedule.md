# Archives + Algorithms Schedule


## Week 1 (Jan 18--22): Introductions
There are a bunch of small set-up things to do for this week, but not much reading.

- Review the syllabus, course aims, assignments, and general plan for the semester.

- Follow the [Zotero setup instructions](http://fredgibbs.net/courses/etc/zotero).

  - Our `Zotero Group homepage` is [https://www.zotero.org/groups/2667261/archives-algorithms](https://www.zotero.org/groups/2667261/archives-algorithms). This link is best for joining the course Zotero Group.

  - Our `Zotero Library page` is [https://www.zotero.org/groups/2667261/archives-algorithms/library](https://www.zotero.org/groups/2667261/archives-algorithms/library). Once you've joined the group, this link is best for accessing our Zotero Library.

#### Set up your digital portfolio
- Go to [wix.com](http://wix.com) and create an account (everything is free; you can opt out of all emails). Click the `Get Started` button in the middle of the page, then the `Sign up` link to enter your email address and set a password.
- Once logged in, Click the `Create New Site`
- You'll be asked what kind of site you want to create---pick `Blog`.
- CAREFUL: On the next page, click the `Choose a Template` button. DO NOT click the other one!
- Pick a design that you like---you can customize it later if you want. We're just getting the blog working right now. When you click on one of the images, it gives you a preview of the site layout and a button to Edit the site. If you like the layout (you'll be customizing it over the semester), click the Edit button. Or close the preview and pick a new layout.
- After a few seconds, you'll end up in the website editor. There's a lot of options and stuff that we don't need. It will become more familiar and easier to use quickly.
- Near the upper left corner of the page, you can change the page you are editing---select the `About` page on your site.
- Edit the bio text to introduce yourself to the class---basic info like major, hobbies, life goals, favorite foods --- and WHY you ended up here and what you hope to get out of the class.
- Click `Save` in the upper right corner.
- Name your site whatever you like.
- Click the `Publish Now` button to make sure your site is visible.
- You don't need to edit the mobile site at all, so just close the dialog box.
- Copy the URL that it shows you (it should look like https://fwgibbs.wixsite.com/aaportfolio) and post it to our [class Google Doc of blog sites](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10vEQMEYl-nd98AcVMQkudAQCCKk3HqkZ1nEXgphiB_8/edit?usp=sharing).


### Introducing Archives and yourself
One very short reading for this week just to get started and as a jumping off point for your first reading reflection.

- Gabriella Giannchi, "A brief history of the archive" (Chapter 1 from _Archive Everything_), 1--15. Note the full article goes to p. 25, so don't read the whole thing! This article can get into the weeds at times, so stay focused on the big picture in terms of a _general_ history of the archive and how it's changed over time.

- Trevor Owens, [What Do you Mean by Archive? Genres of Usage for Digital Preservers](https://blogs.loc.gov/thesignal/2014/02/what-do-you-mean-by-archive-genres-of-usage-for-digital-preservers/).


#### Post your first reading response
- Log into wix.com and select your site to edit it.
- Click the pen icon on the left side of the screen.
- Click `Create a Post`.
- Add a Catchy title.
- Using the Giannchi and Owens readings for this week (link above), write a standard reading reflection on what you thought were the most 3-4 most interesting points in EACH of the articles and WHY. There IS NO RIGHT ANSWER. I'm just curious what you thought was interesting.
- NOTE: This is just a warm-up blog post to make sure everything is working---so no pressure and no grading. But I am looking forward to your posts!
- When you're done, be sure to click `Publish` in the upper right corner.
- Close the dialog box that pops up.
- You're done! Your site at this point will have all kinds of images and stuff that you don't need or want---and we'll clean up our sites over the next few weeks. If you want to start tidying now, go for it!
