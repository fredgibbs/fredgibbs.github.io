## Week 12: Apr 5--9: Erasing History

- All these links are a kind of digital history. How do we talk about how they are all completely different?

## 10: Spatial History, Historical GIS, and Digital Mapping

### Tuesday (Mar 19)


### Thursday (Mar 28)
- Discussion of collaborative **20 point** [UNM spatial history project](unm-spatial-history-guidelines)
  - Before class, read the [UNM Spatial History Guidelines](unm-spatial-history-guidelines).
  - Remember this is a spatial history, not just a building history. For instance, keep in mind how sources like this [Co-Ed Code](https://digitalrepository.unm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1006&context=unm_coed_code) can help you.

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Choose your place' text="
- Before class, pick a building or space on campus. Buildings that no longer exist have important spatial histories, too! Take a few minutes to find something that interests you.
- You can consult this [list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_University_of_New_Mexico_buildings) to get started, but you can do anything you want as long as no one else has claimed it.
- Add your name (in the author column) and building/place (in the place-name column) to our [UNM Campus History Index](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AE1X-dDphqyYjVlUj1w0xvWivnu0e7EtyxzuGNjbock/edit?usp=sharing)
  - Ignore all the other columns for now
  - Note that the data on this page will be used on our collaborative website, take care with details!

- Americo Paredes, _The Hammon and the Beans and Other Stories_ (Houston, TX: Arte Publico Press, 1994), 3-9.
  - How does intersectionality affect how space is conceived or structured? In other words, how is space modified by race, class, and gender? When reading Paredes think about what the landscape tells us about these positionalities. Who moves between the different spaces in the short story, who determines the spacial boundaries and their markers?  What can be read in this movement? As White states in What is Spatial History? (week 9!)  we "produce and reproduce space through our movements and the movements of goods..." and I would add the movement of  ideologies  as well.



## 14: Critiquing Data Interfaces
Review the [data interface critique guidelines](data-interface-critique). Please read the guidelines ahead of time, but there's no other required reading.


- Read the absurd ["Three Peoples Mural" description](https://library.unm.edu/zimmerman75/art.php) from Zimmerman Library, and scan the larger images of the four murals: [1](mural-1.jpg), [2](mural-2.jpg), [3](mural-3.jpg), [4](mural-4.jpg)
