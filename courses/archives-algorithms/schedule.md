# Archives + Algorithms Schedule

## Submitting work
All work for each week is due by when you go to bed on Friday so that I have it early on Saturday morning. You are of course welcome to post your responses and reflections (if there is more than one thing due) any time during the week. Reading responses and weekly reflections must be posted (usually as a blog post) to your website. You'll make separate pages for the other assignments. Keep in mind that our website aren't just an alternative to Learn, but are an integral component of the course.


## Week 1 (Jan 18--22): Introductions
There are a bunch of small set-up things to do for this week, but not much reading.

- Review the syllabus, course aims, assignments, and general plan for the semester.
- Watch a ~short~ reasonable-length [introductory video](https://youtu.be/5rTlho5u62c).
- Follow the [Zotero setup instructions](http://fredgibbs.net/courses/etc/zotero).
  - Our `Zotero Group homepage` is [https://www.zotero.org/groups/2667261/archives-algorithms](https://www.zotero.org/groups/2667261/archives-algorithms). This link is best for joining the course Zotero Group.
  - Our `Zotero Library page` is [https://www.zotero.org/groups/2667261/archives-algorithms/library](https://www.zotero.org/groups/2667261/archives-algorithms/library). Once you've joined the group, this link is best for accessing our Zotero Library.

#### Set up your website (= archive) and about page
- All the following steps, along with bit more explanation, are covered in a [quick screencast](https://youtu.be/t0x3752flqQ) if you prefer to just see them.
- Go to [wix.com](http://wix.com) and create an account (everything is free; you can opt out of all emails). Click the `Get Started` button in the middle of the page, then the `Sign up` link to enter your email address and set a password.
- Once logged in, Click the `Create New Site`
- You'll be asked what kind of site you want to create---pick `Blog`.
- CAREFUL: On the next page, click the `Choose a Template` button. DO NOT click the other one!
- Pick a design that is a good starting point for you (simple is best)---we'll customize it later. When you click on one of the images, it gives you a preview of the site layout and a button to Edit the site. If it looks good enough, click the Edit button. Or close the preview and pick a new layout.
- After about 10 seconds, you'll end up in the website editor. There's a lot of options and stuff that we don't need, but it will quickly become more familiar and easier to use.
- Near the upper left corner of the page, you can change the page you are editing---select the `About` page on your site.
- Edit the bio text to introduce yourself to the class---basic first-day info like major, hobbies, life goals, favorite foods --- and WHY you ended up here and what you hope to get out of the class.
- Click `Save` in the upper right corner.
- Name your site whatever you like.
- Click the `Publish Now` button to make sure your site is visible.
- You don't need to edit the mobile site at all, so just close the dialog box.
- Copy the URL that it shows you (it should look like https://fwgibbs.wixsite.com/archive) and post it to our [class Google Doc of blog sites](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10vEQMEYl-nd98AcVMQkudAQCCKk3HqkZ1nEXgphiB_8/edit?usp=sharing).


### Introducing Archives
Just two short readings for this week as a jumping off point for your first short reading response.

- Gabriella Giannchi, "A brief history of the archive" (Chapter 1 from _Archive Everything_), 1--15. Note the full article goes to p. 25, so don't read the whole thing! This article can get into the weeds at times, so stay focused on the big picture in terms of a _general_ history of the archive and how it's changed over time.

- Trevor Owens, [What Do you Mean by Archive? Genres of Usage for Digital Preservers](https://blogs.loc.gov/thesignal/2014/02/what-do-you-mean-by-archive-genres-of-usage-for-digital-preservers/). Read the comments, too! They are (perhaps unusually so) quite a useful addition to the article itself.


#### Post your first reading response
- Log into wix.com and select your site to edit it.
- Click the pen icon on the left side of the screen.
- Click `Create a Post`.
- Add a Catchy title.
- Using the Giannchi and Owens readings for this week (see above), write a standard reading response on what definition(s) of archive (from Owens) you think Giannchi is primarily interested in. How do the various definitions offered by Owens complicate Giannchi's description?  There is NO RIGHT ANSWER.
- NOTE: This is just a warm-up blog post to make sure everything is working---so no pressure and no grading! But I am looking forward to your thoughts, and this is the kind of assignment you'll be doing much of the semester--trying to combine two different readings for the week.
- When you're done, be sure to click `Publish` in the upper right corner.
- Close the dialog box that pops up.
- You're done! Your site at this point will have all kinds of images and stuff that you don't need or want. We'll clean up our sites over the next few weeks, but if you want to start tidying now, go for it!



## Week 2 (Jan 25--29): Archival Practice and Data Futures
This week we read an article that describes the relationship between historians and archivists---particularly how historians have regarded archival work uncritically and as providing an objective way of accessing the past. The other article describes how so many ways of sorting, organizing, and storing elements of culture (the exact work that archivists have done) have become automated processes.

- Check out the [Week 2 overview video](https://youtu.be/NLWZAkXRDaU), which gives an introduction to each article and some ideas for how to connect them in your weekly reflection this week.


- Terry Cook, ‘The Archive(s) Is a Foreign Country: Historians, Archivists, and the Changing Archival Landscape’, _The American Archivist_ 33 (2011): 600--632.

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Reading Response' text="
- In response to the Cook article: Especially in terms of the history of the archive, what in the article you find most interesting and/or confusing?
"%}

- Ted Striphas, ‘Algorithmic Culture’, _European Journal of Cultural Studies_, 18.4–5 (2015): 395–412.

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Weekly Reflection' text="
This [weekly reflection](weekly-reflections) is space for you to put the two articles together: What can algorithmic culture learn from the history of the archive? How can our thinking about information, crowd, and algorithm be informed by how historians have used archives? Can you think of a keyword that, compared to past usage, represents a cultural shift of the 21st century?

We'll return to this question at the end of the class (after we've read a lot more), and it will be useful to document/archive our preliminary thinking here. As always, THERE IS NO RIGHT ANSWER. Just show me you're reading and trying to think about the future of data/algorithms via the history of the archive.
"%}



## Week 3 (Feb 1--5): Power
This week we're looking at the power of archives, which includes a whole range of meanings as we got a sample of last time. A quote at the end of the first article sums up the gist of point for the week to keep in mind while reading. Archival power means: _Power over the documentary record, and by extension over the collective  memory of marginalized members of society – whether women, non-whites, gays and lesbians, children, the under-classes, prisoners, and the non-literate – and indeed over their representation and integration into the metanarratives of history._

Keep in mind, too, the parallels between societal data and archives and the power they yield. Of course power, whether through physical records, digital facsimiles, or data, is mediated through interfaces, whether a digital archive website or an algorithm that computes your SAT or GRE score.

For an overview of some key themes for the week, check out the [Week 3 Overview Video](https://youtu.be/6iXuOhqTwlA).

- Joan M. Schwartz and Terry Cook, “Archives, Records and Power: The Making of Modern Memory,” 1–19. This article is a little repetitive at times, but in a good way as it makes it easy to understand the main points. It is shorter than it looks in terms of page count because many pages are almost entirely footnotes (which you can peruse if you're interested).
- Margaret Hedstrom, “Archives, Memory, and Interfaces with the Past,” 21–43. This article overlaps a little with the other other, which doesn't mention interfaces at all, and makes for a very productive complement. There is a section on memory pp. 27--32, that you can skim; it's more productive for us to keep our focus on interfaces.

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Weekly Reflection' text="
- Just one writing assignment---a [weekly reflection](weekly-reflections)---due this week: Drawing equally from the two readings for this week, pick a few questions to answer. I think they are all equally useful to think about, but you don't have enough space to get into ALL of them in your response. As always: your responses must draw extensively from the readings!
  - How would you describe the relationship between archives, power, and memory?
  - How do you suppose archives have shaped your identity (p.16)? Note the discussion of identity isn't so much about how YOU see yourself, but how OTHERS see you (via the history of the archive).
  - What impacts/influences do interfaces have on how archives create/maintain power?
  - In what ways is Wikipedia an archive? How is it not? (Careful---this is for those looking for a challenge!)
  - How might interfaces you use everyday be more influential (on you and/or society) than you might expect?
"%}


## Week 4 (Feb 8--12): Silence
This week is an extension/elaboration on last week's POWER theme. The Policing and Mass Incarceration Archive blog post is just for fun, as it perfectly embodies the kind of action/corrective that Carter is calling for in 2006. As I explain in the video, our main readings are an unusual but I hope provocative pair. A little bit less of an academic reflection for this week, as described below.  

- [Week 4 Overview Video](https://youtu.be/fesjoo-Ysc8) (mostly highlights from Carter, some context and reflections on Hartman, and a note about the reflection due Friday)
- Rodney G. S. Carter, “Of Things Said and Unsaid: Power, Archival Silences, and Power in Silence” _Archivaria_, September 25, 2006, 215–33.
- Saidiya Hartman, "Venus in Two Acts." _Small Axe_ 12.2 (2008): 1-14.
- A recent news item about addressing silences: [UCLA to Establish Archive on Policing and Mass Incarceration in Los Angeles](https://mellon.org/news-blog/articles/ucla-establish-archive-policing-and-mass-incarceration-los-angeles/)
- Check out [this data-driven digital project](https://enslaved.org/) to fill silences about individuals who were enslaved.

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Archival Silence' text="
- Normally we can only speculate about archival silences. In this 'special' assignment (a lot like a weekly reflection but POSTED AS A SEPARATE PAGE on your website), you will consider a silence about which you have intimate knowledge. Look through the photos on your phone (or wherever you keep photos). Drawing from the provocations in the readings, analyze the silences in your own archive. Make it VERY CLEAR you are using the course readings---from both this and previous weeks---to inform your analysis. More details (and advice) are available on the [Archival Silence Assignment Guide](archival-silences).
"%}


## Week 5 (Feb 15--19): Classification
Building on the overlapping themes of power and silences, this week we look at how the act of classification (that's been mentioned in almost every article so far) can both remove and in fact CREATE archival silences. We're back to a regular weekly reflection this week.


- [Week 5 Overview video](https://youtu.be/W1wlqjGnDK0)
- Marisa Elena Duarte and Miranda Belarde-Lewis, “Imagining: Creating Spaces for Indigenous Ontologies,” _Cataloging & Classification Quarterly_ 53, no. 5–6 (July 4, 2015): 677–702. Focus on everything up through p.688; after that, skim the case studies and examples to think about how the theory discussed at the beginning of the article can be and is being put into practice in the real world.
- Jennifer Guiliano and Carolyn Heitman, “Difficult Heritage and the Complexities of Indigenous Data,” _Journal of Cultural Analytics_ (August 13, 2019).

#### Relevant but optional
- Melissa Adler and Lindsey M. Harper, “Race and Ethnicity in Classification Systems: Teaching Knowledge Organization from a Social Justice Perspective”, _Library Trends_ 67.1 (2018): 52–73.

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Weekly Reflection' text="
- One question that can help you to think about the overlaps and differences between the two readings this week for your [weekly reflection](weekly-reflections): How are the challenges/opportunities related to indigenous data (described in Guiliano and Heitman) the same and different from the general concerns about ontologies and cataloging/classifying (described in Duarte and Belarde-Lewis)? If you prefer, you can take my suggestion and just write about your own reactions to these articles and the issues they are covering.
"%}


## Week 6 (Feb 22--26): Interface
As you are all acutely aware at this point: classification, access, and dissemination go hand in hand in hand (is that a thing?). Mediating all of these, as we've already seen in our week on archival power, are interfaces. The article we read that focused on interfaces (Hesdtrom) discussed them in generic, theoretical terms. I emphasized that we should think about interfaces on multiple levels. This week, we're focusing on digital interfaces to archives and critiquing them according to the readings we've done in the course so far that suggest different ways in which archives shape identity, heritage, and history. How do digital interfaces to archives wield power?

- [Week 6 Overview video](https://youtu.be/rk53Dk1q1eQ)
- Jefferson Bailey, [Disrespect Des Fonds: Rethinking Arrangement and Description in Born-Digital Archives](http://dev.archivejournal.net/?p=4722)
- Mitchell Whitelaw, [Generous Interfaces for Digital Cultural Collections](http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/9/1/000205/000205.html). For more concrete examples of interfaces, skim through [more examples](https://lab.sciencemuseum.org.uk/exploring-museum-collections-online-some-background-reading-da5a332fa2f8)


### Sample Digital Archive/History Projects
For your assignment this week, you can critique any of these. You're also welcome to find something else or use something you already know about. If going off-list, make sure whatever site you choose is some kind of interface to an archive and allows you to address the questions in the assignment guide.

## Week 7 (March 1--5): Decolonial, post-custodial, community archives
- Andrew Flinn, Mary Stevens, and Elizabeth Shepherd, "Whose Memories, Whose Archives? Independent Community Archives, Autonomy and the Mainstream", _Archival Science_, 9 (2009):71--86.
  - An older article that gives a good sense of the history of community archives and why they emerged, and the problems with simply knowing about them (one of the downsides of not being a mainstream archive). Also an interesting discussion about the relationship between identity and archives. There are many skimmable details related to specific projects (at least for our purposes), but overall is a very nice overview.
- Michelle Caswell, “Seeing Yourself in History: Community Archives and the Fight Against Symbolic Annihilation,” _The Public Historian_ 36.4 (2014): 26--37.
  - A case study of sorts, but with some useful theory and reflection about how community archives intersect with many of the issues we've been reading about.
- Jimmy Zavala et al., “‘A Process Where We’re All at the Table’: Community Archives Challenging Dominant Modes of Archival Practice”, _Archives and Manuscripts_ 45, no. 3 (2017): 202--15.
  - Sort of like a roundtable of case studies, but that highlights many practical issues with founding, energizing, and sustaining community archives.

### Relevant (but optional)
- Siobhan Senier, “Decolonizing the Archive: Digitizing Native Literature with Students and Tribal Communities.” _Resilience: A Journal of the Environmental Humanities_, 1.3 (2014).
- María Cotera, “Nuestra Autohistoria: Toward a Chicana Digital Praxis,” _American Quarterly_ 70.3 (2018): 483–504.
-  J. J. Ghaddar and Michelle Caswell, "'To Go beyond': Towards a Decolonial Archival Praxis", _Archival Science_, 19.2 (2019), 71--85. But it really goes just to the top of 81.


{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Weekly Reflection' text="
- For your [weekly reflection](weekly-reflections) this week, outline what YOU see as the biggest advantages and disadvantages of community archives? Does the long history of the archive(s) in general (mostly not addressed in the articles for this week) give us any insight into how to or how not to cultivate community archives? Do they solve more problems than they create?
"%}


## Week 8 (Mar 8--12): Reflecting on Archives
No new readings this week. One last pre-break reflection (although about 2x the usual length since we're thinking about ALL the weeks) to wrap up our archival side of the course.

We learned a fair amount about the history of archives, archivists, relationships between historians and archives/archivists, archival power, silences, interfaces, etc. But what if the point has never been to learn about archives per se, but about how to think critically about knowledge infrastructures---how we learn anything about the world, whether through favorite podcasts, network news, Facebook, online news outlets, Twitter, whatever. I contend, for the purposes of debate, that everything we read about in terms of archives applies to basically every source of information. The same kinds of biases creep in, the same kinds of silences, the same limitations and exploratory possibilities of interfaces (and algorithms, not to get ahead of ourselves). What do you think?

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='1/2 Semester Reflection' text="
- For your [weekly reflection](weekly-reflections) this week (but extended ~1400 words), outline what from the lectures, readings, and responses thus far will stick with you OUTSIDE THE CONTEXT OF ARCHIVES. To what extent to you agree with my claim that the issues we've been reading about make sense outside of archives? How is it mostly true? How is it misguided?
