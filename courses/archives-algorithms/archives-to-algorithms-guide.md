# From Archives to Algorithms
This essay should be written as an op-ed style opinion piece for a major newspaper. The goal is to write a smart, informed argument about what the history of archives can tell us about the future of algorithms using the materials from the course. You can argue for anything you'd like---it's an op-ed after all---but it needs to be CAREFULLY GROUNDED in the readings.

You might argue that most or all of the archival challenges we've discussed apply to algorithms; you might argue that very few or none of them do. There is no right answer. There are only more and less effective ways of making an informed argument.


## Style
You're right for a broad audience who knows virtually nothing about neither archives nor algorithms. You definitely don't want to assume your reader has read the same stuff you have. But nor do they care what articles you're drawing from---they are reading to understand your view and your position.

## Citations
As with a typical op-ed, you should not have any citations. But as a pretend op-ed and a real class assignment, it should be obvious that you're drawing from the wide array of course readings. Make sure you're looking for this as you review your assignment before posting it.


Weekly Reflections
Your weekly reflections should indicate key takeaways from, critiques of, and questions about the readings. With just a few exceptions, I think they are all very accessible and don't need much of an introduction. I think this was less true for the archive articles that were geared toward an audience of archivists. Therefore, I think it would be more productive to spend time responding to what you're doing and have more of a conversation than telling you what you should learn from the readings when there is more than anyone can absorb in one reading anyway.

These reflections should be very useful for you as you prepare your Archives to Algorithms essay.


## Grading
- A/A-: **Excellent**. Presents an original, expressive, and sophisticated analysis of what the student has learned and how the readings relate to each other. It combines many specific examples from the readings with a detailed personal narrative of how they affected (or didn't) the student's thinking about diet and health.
- B+/B: **Very good**. Provides excellent coverage of course topics, themes, and readings, with more than a few specific examples, connects readings from throughout the course, and demonstrates a clear emphasis on creating a learning reflection rather than course summary.
- B-/C+: **Good**. Provides solid coverage of course topics, themes, and readings---with some examples---but tends more towards summary than a learning narrative.
- C/C-: **Fine**. Shows some evidence of thinking critically about core topics from the course, covers a wide variety of course themes, but does not demonstrate much knowledge of course content beyond superficial descriptions.
- D: **Marginal**. Basically summarizes or paraphrases the syllabus, but shows enough familiarity with the majority readings to get some points.
- F: **Not good**. Incoherent, overly general summary of some topics, many topics missing, minimal examples or engagement with readings.
