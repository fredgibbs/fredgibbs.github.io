# HIST 300-007: Learning Journal

## Introduction
The short reading responses are meant to encourage you to keep up with the reading and to reflect on it so as to internalize the main points. The Learning Journal exercises, due most weeks, offer a chance to reflect on that week's topic as a whole. There is not a specific question to answer, nor are you meant to summarize what you read for the week. I want to hear what you THINK about what you read and how it relates to previous readings of the class.

You may have found the readings totally uninteresting. That's cool---I might, too. But you should try to reflect on why they are useful for us in the context of the course. What did you learn? What was confusing? What ideas did you find most interesting? What aspects were boring? How did the readings help you think about the week's topic differently? Or not? What questions do you have?

These are meant to be open-ended descriptions of your learning experience! It's impossible to learn everything worth knowing from each article after one reading (or several). I certainly haven't. The point of this exercise is to help you solidify in your mind what you did take away from the readings as a whole with specific examples from the individual readings. We're all interested in different things and in a position to learn different things from the readings. So tell me what your experience was for the week.


## Basics
- **~800--900 words**: Write more or less as you need/want to per assignment, but don't be consistently too much above or below the target.
- **Original thinking**: Avoid summarizing readings except to restate a point that you want to elaborate on.
- **Polished writing**: Don't try to sound like an academic, but your post shouldn't read like a text message, either. Overly informal posts will lower your grade by 1/3 to 2/3 grade (A to B+, for instance).
- **Posted ON TIME at UNM Learn**: ON TIME means by MIDNIGHT on the due date. As explained on the main syllabus page, you can turn work in up to two days late for full credit, but that's it. After that, you will get a zero. I don't mean to sound draconian, but too much leeway with assignments creates too much temptation to let them slide, and then they aren't effective and serve only to create busywork.



## Scoring and how these factor in your grade
I'd prefer not to give a grade on these, but it makes giving you a grade at the end of the semester (which I have to do) much easier and transparent. So for your entries I indicate to you on a point scale what it seems to me your engagement was for the week based on your response. It's not a grade on whether you go the right answer---there isn't one---but how much effort you seem to put into learning from the articles and short introductory lectures each week.

I use the scale below with .5 point increments. For exceptional responses, which might be a bit longer and more insightful than a typical journal reflection (because you were really interested in the topic), I give UP TO 3 points EXTRA CREDIT. This makes it easy to make up points you may have missed on an entry that you didn't have time to do particularly well.

- 9--10 points: Clearly demonstrates broad familiarity with the readings across the week, exhibits original thinking, connects current readings to past readings, and is clearly articulated.

- 7--8 points: Shows familiarity with the readings and offers some critical reflection on key themes, but could use refinement either in thinking or writing.

- 5--6 points: Some effort, but doesn't show much engagement with the readings or is difficult to understand.

- <5 points: You posted _something_, but it looks like you were posting without reading much at all, and just offering an uninformed opinion.

- 0 points: Nothing posted, or otherwise so unintelligible that I can't even guess at what you were trying to do.
