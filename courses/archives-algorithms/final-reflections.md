# Final Learning Reflection
Your final assignment for the course is a bit different from previous assignments.

_Sorry for the long instructions here---I'm just trying to be as clear and explicit as possible. Let me know if you have any questions!_

I'd like you to write a ~1600-word argument for what letter grade you should get for the course. Most importantly---as a final exercise AND justification for your grade---your essay will describe your learning experience throughout the course, including providing SPECIFIC EXAMPLES FROM THE READINGS. What did you learn about archives? About algorithms?

I can't emphasize enough that your final reflections should be personal statements about YOUR LEARNING EXPERIENCE, not just a recitation of course topics and themes. If all you do is summarize some readings without including your reaction to them (unfavorable reactions are fine!), I can only assume that you didn't put in very much effort into the course.



## Why make an argument for a grade?
It's maybe a weird way to frame a final, but there is a specific reason. I recognize that your effort to learn, and what you actually did learn, might not be represented in your individual assignments.

The point here is that this final learning reflection will CONNECT DIFFERENT TOPICS AND THEMES AND READINGS for the course. I hope it's obvious that the sample (even in its intense vagueness) gives specific examples from the readings to illustrate a learning experience. In NO WAY does it resemble a week-by-week summary of the syllabus.

At this point in the course, it's clear everyone is going to get at least a B+. How much more than that really depends on this final assignment.



## Pro tips for success

### Take time to review
Before you start writing, over the next few weeks, you should invest a few hours time to REVIST THE READINGS---not necessarily re-reading them---to remind yourself what you've read, or maybe reading a little more of something you could only skim before. You should absolutely use the DISCUSSION BOARD to remind you of what was going on over the many weeks of class. ALL THOSE POSTS are more than just assignments for you to do---they are our course archive that makes the key ideas from the course and the readings easily accessible. The VIDEO LECTURES can be tedious, but they all try to pull together broader themes and explain how different weeks fit together. If you just clicked through these quickly , you're missing out on the connective tissue for the course (which I'm looking for in the final).


### BE SPECIFIC!
I may have mentioned this once or twice in the course already. Specificity and clarity (in thinking and organization) is what separates excellent from mediocre work. To say that "I learned to think more critically about archives" will sound unconvincing unless you provide several specific examples of the issues that you think are important to think critically about and WHY. If you just make a vague statement that you learned about a topic on the syllabus ("I learned that algorithms can discriminate against certain people"), and you don't provide any examples from the readings, or don't connect different readings together, I can only assume it's because you didn't read or learn very much.



### Think holistically
The more you can tie themes together and speak about the course as a whole (while giving specific examples from the readings---yes, I'm going to keep repeating it), the higher your score will be. Essays that speak very generally about one topic after the other in the order of the syllabus will make a case that you haven't really made any connections. Almost every single reading can be related to at least a handful of others on the syllabus. Many of you have been doing this in your posts of late---keep it up! When I see those connections in your final, I know you're putting in the work to make them.

One last time: telling me what you were SUPPOSED to learn (that is, paraphrasing the syllabus) is very different from describing YOUR LEARNING EXPERIENCE.



## Grading
- A/A-: **Excellent**. Presents an original, expressive, and sophisticated analysis of what the student has learned and how the readings relate to each other. It combines many specific examples from the readings with a detailed personal narrative of how they affected (or didn't) the student's thinking about diet and health.
- B+/B: **Very good**. Provides excellent coverage of course topics, themes, and readings, with more than a few specific examples, connects readings from throughout the course, and demonstrates a clear emphasis on creating a learning reflection rather than course summary.
- B-/C+: **Good**. Provides solid coverage of course topics, themes, and readings---with some examples---but tends more towards summary than a learning narrative.
- C/C-: **Fine**. Shows some evidence of thinking critically about core topics from the course, covers a wide variety of course themes, but does not demonstrate much knowledge of course content beyond superficial descriptions.
- D: **Marginal**. Basically summarizes or paraphrases the syllabus, but shows enough familiarity with the majority readings to get some points.
- F: **Not good**. Incoherent, overly general summary of some topics, many topics missing, minimal examples or engagement with readings.
