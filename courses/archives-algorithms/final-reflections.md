# Final Learning Reflection
Your final reflection for the course is a bit different from previous reflections.

I'd like you to write a ~800-word description of YOUR LEARNING EXPERIENCE in the course as a whole. What kinds of things will stick with you?

## Experience over summary
I can't emphasize enough that your final reflection should be personal statements about YOUR LEARNING EXPERIENCE and thoughts about the course, not just a recitation of course topics and themes. You are already doing that kind of summary/review work for your op-ed. This is not as much about specific course topics/material as about your own view of what you got out of the course as a whole, including whether the readings were easy enough to understand, whether the topics were mostly interesting, whether the assignments were useful exercises to facilitate learning, etc.

## Purpose
It's also very useful for me to see what beyond the individual readings and topics listed on the syllabus have made an impact. I'm looking for a thoughtful response about your experience in the course, no matter what your opinion of the course might be. I'm well aware that some things worked reasonably well and others not so much. Explaining WHY certain aspects of the course did NOT work for you is great way of doing well on the assignment. But be sure you're explaining (ie providing reasons) and not just complaining (saying you didn't like something without any further explanation as to why).

## Grading
This final reflection, however you decide to write it, is one last opportunity for a grade tweak. Basically, if you're on the bubble between two grades (usually A / A- or B+ / A-), a thoughtful reflection here gets you the higher grade. A mostly superficial reflection, but with some effort behind it, doesn't really affect your grade one way or the other. Not doing the assignment or making a minimal effort can lower your grade one notch (A to A-).
