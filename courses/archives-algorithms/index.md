# Archives + Algorithms

## Logistics
- Remote asynchronous
- Fred Gibbs \([fwgibbs@unm.edu](mailto:fwgibbs@unm.edu)\)


## Course Description
This interdisciplinary course explores the effects of the digital age on producing and consuming history. Some guiding questions:

- What are effective ways of making the past visible and useful?
- How does human and algorithmic bias affect our access to information?
- How do the politics of archives help shape our sense of the past?
- How are historians adapting research and publication practices to use digitized archives and historical data?
- How does technology shape our access to the past?
- How does the Web change the kinds and forms of history that should be produced?
- How does the Web (and resources like Wikipedia) change perceptions of history?
- How can historians engage with these methods to improve information literacy?

In addressing these questions, we'll draw from contemporary readings in history, public history, historiography, digital humanities, literary studies, media studies, and library and museum studies. Along with our readings, we will investigate a variety of digital history, archival, and journalistic projects that feature various digital methods (such as text analysis, mapping, data visualization, and so on). We’ll critique the various facets of these projects (data, design, interface, utility, etc.) to understand the technologies and data involved.


## Student Learning Outcomes
- Think critically about how technology shapes our access to and interpretations of the past
- Examine the impact of the digitization of cultural heritage and how digital archives reshape our access to the past
- Begin to experiment with new tools, workflows, methods, and techniques for large-scale research questions in history
- Identify cultural and algorithmic biases in searching for historical information
- Critique how digital publishing challenges historical authority and expertise


## Work Requirements and Grading
NOTE THAT ALL WORK IS OPTIONAL! You need to do as many assignments to get whatever grade you want. There are more assignments given than anyone needs to do. Do the ones that interest you and do them well! Note that point values are the MAXIMUM possible, not what you get for merely completing them.

- Reading responses (0-2 points each). See the [Response guidelines](response-guidelines). You can write a response for EACH item on the syllabus; so if there are two readings for one day, you can write two responses and get double points that day. You can always write responses on optional readings. There are 20(!) readings left as of 3/26; about 10 are required. All responses do have to be done BEFORE class, though.
- Analog/Digital Search Comparison---see Feb 7 (10 points)
- [Transcription Assignment](transcription-guidelines) (10 points)
- Topic Modeling of Medical History Journals---see March 5 (10 points)
- [Geo-referencing exercise](georeferencing-guidelines) (10 points)
- [Spatial History Project](unm-spatial-history-guidelines) (20 points)
- [Visual Essay](visual-essay-guidelines) (10 points)
- [Data Interface Critique](data-interface-critique) (10 points)
- Complete and clean Digital Portfolio (10 points)


### Grade Distribution
Note everything is 10 points less than before to make up for getting behind earlier and not presenting enough scoring opportunities.

Percent | Grade

94+ | A
90-94 | A-
87-89 | B+
83-86 | B
80-82 | B-
77-79 | C+
73-76 | C
70-72 | C-
67-69 | D+
60-66 | D
59- | F


### Please Ask for Help
I heartily encouraged you to speak with me at any time about how I think you're doing in the class and how you can improve your performance (if at all). If life gets overwhelming during the course (as it easily can these days), it can be tempting to drift away from an elective course like this. Rather than disappear, let's work something out to accommodate your circumstances and thus avoid digging a huge hole from which it becomes increasingly difficult to escape.

## Readings
There are NO REQUIRED BOOKS for this course. But you will need to subscribe to the course Zotero library to access assigned articles. This will be discussed in class, but for reference, please see the [instructions for connecting](http://fredgibbs.net/courses/etc/zotero.html). The URL for the group library is [https://www.zotero.org/groups/1647219/digital-history-unm/items](https://www.zotero.org/groups/1647219/digital-history-unm/items).

## Students with Disabilities
The American with Disabilities Act (ADA) is a federal anti-discrimination statute that provides comprehensive civil rights protection for persons with disabilities. Among other things, this legislation requires that all students with disabilities be guaranteed a learning environment that provides for reasonable accommodations of their disabilities.
