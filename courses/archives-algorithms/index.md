# HIST 300-007: Archives + Algorithms

## Logistics
- Remote Arranged (fully online, no scheduled meetings); everything (except this syllabus) on UNM Learn
- 3 Credit Hours
- Prof. Fred Gibbs \([fwgibbs@unm.edu](mailto:fwgibbs@unm.edu)\)
- No set student hours, but always happy to Zoom chat


## Course Description
Archives determine the histories that get written. While the idea of an archive typically refers to collections of historic documents, we can now think of all corporate and consumer data (smartphone use, search history, surveillance footage, fitbit stats, financial and medical records) as an impossibly detailed archive of human activity. Yet this raises important questions: Who controls different facets of this archive? Who can access it? How is this data archive increasingly managed and understood by algorithms? How does systemic racism and bias creep into supposedly objective retrieval functions? This course explores how can the long history of the archive, and its many problems with selection bias, preservation, and access, can help us understand the future of data and its (mis)uses.


## Student Learning Outcomes
- Recognize significant cultural and ideological shifts in the history of the archive
- Examine the impact of the digitization of cultural heritage and how emerging digital archives are reshaping the past and present
- Think critically about how hidden algorithms shape our access to and interpretations of information
- Identify cultural and socioeconomic biases baked into modern data
- Understand the future of data in society from the history of the archive


## Imagination over regurgitation
This course eschews the typical course narrative in favor of a more exploratory adventure. Therefore, is not for anyone looking for a standard linear, information-delivery kind of course. There's nothing wrong with those; this just isn't one of them. Diversity is good.

As you can see from the [schedule page](schedule), we spend roughly the first half of the course investigating the history of the archive and how it's been rapidly transformed in the last 30 years. Then, we spend roughly the second half of the course reading about the invisible algorithms at work in modern society and theorizing about how the history of the archives might give us some insight into the future of a data- and algorithmic-driven world.

Assignments will tend to be speculative and creative exercises that allow you to APPLY the readings to a particular problem or question rather than just summarize or restate information.


## General Workload
Most of the work is this: You will read 2-3 reasonable-length articles or book chapters per week, and post an entry to your learning journal on THURSDAY (so that I can respond on Fridays). I'll provide a few guiding questions, but these entries are pretty freeform. The only requirement is that you show your familiarity with the readings. Sometimes you'll focus on the articles separately; other times you'll be asked to synthesize them and talk about them as a group. The questions will be abstract and hypothetical and invite you to draw your own conclusions from the readings. You'll post your response, and if it doesn't seem like you're using the readings (or reading them at all), I'll ask some follow up questions rather than just give you a low score. If you care about your grade, you can address them; if not, we just keep moving on. I understand sometimes your priorities will be elsewhere.

There are a few other assignments, too, to break up the monotony of the journal entries, such as short reading response assignments, a few quizzes, and a few one off "special" assignments (they each have special instruction pages as listed below).


## You are welcome here
This course is probably very unlike most history/humanities courses you've taken. But I want to be VERY CLEAR: Even if you have never thought about archives or algorithms (much less how they are related), or have never taken a history or humanities course, YOU ARE WELCOME HERE! This course assumes you know NOTHING about either archives or algorithms (or even what they are, which is actually a trickier question than you might think), and introduces and explores each of them as a metaphor for interacting with knowledge infrastructures all around us.

I will do everything I can do help you learn as much as you're motivated to learn, and to help you get whatever grade you're aiming for. I've tried to make the course about everyone thinking together rather than just you memorizing something I say or you read so that you can regurgitate it later; I've tried to make assignments less anxiety-producing by facilitating (hopefully) you holding yourself accountable rather than me assigning point values to everything.

If you feel the course structure or assignments aren't facilitating your success or reflecting your effort, let's talk! (virtually, of course)


## Work Requirements and Grading
This course has an atypical grading procedure, so be sure you understand how everything works to avoid unpleasant surprises later on. My goal is to have us doing things that are sort of fun to do and help us learn without a dark, mysterious shadow of an anxiety-inducing grade looming over everything. Explanations of how work is evaluated (or not) is explained on each assignment instruction page (links directly below).

The general expectation is that you'll do about one reading or lecture response (~250 words) per week AND one entry in your learning journal (~800 words) for the set of readings for the week. These are all more or less pass/fail assignments and a chance for me to respond to your learning experience and add to the course rather than me assigning a seemingly arbitrary point value on how "good" you did. If I don't see your engagement with the readings, I just ask you to elaborate on some points you brought up or on a reading that you didn't mention much or at all so that you can get a pass for the assignment. I will let you fail only if you insist on it. If you're getting passes (I keep everyone informed about how they are doing as I respond to your work), then you're getting full points for those components of the course.

The other assignments besides those are a little different in that they ask you to do a thing and think critically about it using the readings. These ARE graded in terms of points because it's useful to have a little pressure once in a while.

- [Reading/lecture Responses](reading-responses) (pass/fail; 50 points total)
- [Learning Journal Entries](learning-journal) (pass/fail 150 points total )
- [Archival Silence Analysis](archival-silence-analysis) (20 points x 1)
- [Transcription Assignment](transcription-guidelines) (20 points x 1)
- [Data Interface Critique](data-interface-critique) (20 points x 1)
- [Final Course Reflection](final-reflections) (40 points x 1)

### Please Ask for Help
I heartily encouraged you to speak with me at any time about how I think you're doing in the class and how you can improve your performance (if at all). If life gets overwhelming during the course (as it easily can these days), it can be tempting to drift away from an elective course like this. Rather than disappear, let's work something out to accommodate your circumstances and thus avoid digging a huge hole from which it becomes increasingly difficult to escape.

## Readings
There are NO REQUIRED BOOKS for this course. But you will need to subscribe to the course Zotero library to access assigned articles. This will be discussed in class, but for reference, please see the [instructions for connecting](http://fredgibbs.net/courses/etc/zotero.html).
