# Links and Guides
This page contains links that you will need at some point. There's nothing new on this page---all these links appear on the syllabus as well (usually in multiple places)---but it can be sometimes helpful to have everything in one place.

## Submitting Work
TBD

## Readings
We use a tool called Zotero to manage PDFs of reading assignments apart from the books. As you read the [Zotero set up instructions](/courses/etc/zotero), you will need the following links. Save yourself confusion by reading the directions FIRST.

Our `Zotero Group homepage` is [https://www.zotero.org/groups/2667261/archives-algorithms](https://www.zotero.org/groups/2667261/archives-algorithms). This link is best for JOINING the course Zotero Group.

Our `Zotero Library page` is [https://www.zotero.org/groups/2667261/archives-algorithms/library](https://www.zotero.org/groups/2667261/archives-algorithms/library). This link is best for ACCESSING our Zotero Library once you're already a member of our group.


## Videos
[YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgNw10VCNMLcWV4hVM_bRPw). All course videos will appear here. There should be links on the syllabus under the day it they are published as well.
