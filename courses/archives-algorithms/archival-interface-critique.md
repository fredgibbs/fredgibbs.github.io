# Archival Interface Critique

## Basic Requirements
- Needs to be a separate PAGE on your site, NOT just a blog post (like archival silences)
- ~800 words, but the quality is far more important than the quantity
- Judicious use of subheadings to delineate your main topics
- Clear, concise, and meaningful writing (no fluff!)
- Must include at least 4 screenshots of what you're critiquing
- Reflect critically on what you're doing using course readings. This is not optional---the point of the readings is that you can use them!

## Goals of critiques
Like any critique or review, you should:
- Provide a BRIEF summary of the main features / functionality of archival access
- Note the stated or apparent intended audience
- Comment on how well the site motivates your interest in their sources/material
- Note aspects that work well
- Note aspects that need improvement (and why!)
- Incorporate our readings about interfaces (_yes in fact there was a reason we read all those!_)

## What's behind the curtain?
Your essay should not simply answer these questions one by one. Think about them holistically as you  formulate and draft your critique.
- What are the original sources? How accessible does the site make them?
- How easy is it to learn more about the sources and possible selection bias?
- Do you get a sense what data exists and what doesn't?
- How might the interfaces/visualizations be misleading?
- What kind of discovery or interpretation does the archive enable? What does it resist? Where are the silences?


## PRO TIPS
- Avoid writing a 'process narrative'---that is, a description of "First I clicked this, then I clicked that, but it didn't work, so I clicked something else." **Nobody cares what you clicked on**.
- Organize your critiques by the particular points you want to make. This helps you avoid a rambling or process-narrative critique.
- Don't miss the forest for the trees. Whatever your particular experience may have been, you should always remember that people reading your review are looking for the big picture (the forest), not particular details (the trees). In more concrete terms, if someone asks you if a movie is good, you don't ramble on for 15 minutes about the lighting in one 5 second scene. Think about the whole thing!
