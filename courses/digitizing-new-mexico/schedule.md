# IN PROGRESS!
This syllabus is a living document and changes frequently, depending on what's going on in the course. If you print it out, you'll need to keep your paper version up to date with the online version. I will always announce important changes in class.


One class for visiting AMH (should be a few weeks before break)

Research progress reports?

Develop list of themes available in the archive; students can choose one. If they want to hunt around in archive and come up with something else, fine.

how many sources or different kinds of sources can we expect students to use?

have reviews very early so that experience can help inform essay development

* Add a markdown file you create in [Dillinger](https://dillinger.io/) to our  [repository](https://github.com/unm-digital-futures/digital-history-review). Be sure you are logged into GitHub when you do this: Click on the 'docs' folder, then drag and drop your file onto your browser window.

## 13: Reviews

### Tuesday (Apr 9)
* Robert Blackey, “Words to the Whys: Crafting Critical Book Reviews,” 159–66.

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='DUE: Last Updates' text="
* Make sure your essays looks and reads exactly as you want, **and as I want**. This will make peer review more useful for both authors and reviewers. Review the [Peer Critique Guidelines](peer-critique-guidelines)!
* IMAGES: You may find that you want to resize, rotate, or crop your images to improve the layout of your essay. While you can control the width easily already, sometimes a bit more editing would go a long way. Use either [Fotor](https://www.fotor.com/) or [Pixlr](https://pixlr.com/express/). Both are online, free, and straightforward image editing tools that you can figure out with a few minutes of playing around. They both do color correction, filtering, and effects, but mostly you'll just want to crop, rotate, or resize images---which are super easy to do---and then download a new version of your file. You can't edit your image on GitHub directly; you'll have to upload a new version.
