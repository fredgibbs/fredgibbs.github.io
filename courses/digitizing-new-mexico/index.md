## Course Description
This interdisciplinary course explores the effects of the digital age on producing and consuming history. Some guiding questions:

- How can historians adapt research and publication practices to use digitized archives and historical data?
- How does technology shape our access to the past?
- How does the Web (and resources like Wikipedia) change perceptions of history and accuracy?


In addressing these questions, we'll draw from contemporary readings in history, public history, historiography, digital humanities, literary studies, media studies, and library and museum studies.

Reading only goes so far, however. More importantly, this course presents students with a unique opportunity to directly engage with digital archival practices, historical research with an unpublished archive, and experience with creating digital essays for the web. All work done in the course becomes is part of ongoing efforts to make New Mexico's rich history more visible and accessible.

For this semester, we will partner with the Acequia Madre House (AMH) in Santa Fe, which holds an extraordinarily rich but largely invisible and unpublished historical archive. Students will get hands-on experience digitizing primary sources from the AMH and using their archival materials to write a historical essay about some facet of the AMH--including, for instance, ties to the famous composer Sibelius, deep connections to Santa Fe artists, and research for an unpublished manuscript on native healing plants.

Working together, the class will create a new prototype website for the AMH that will be integrated into its official website. All class essays produced by using the AMH archive (and others) will be published as a way of increasing the visibility and highlighting this hidden resource for New Mexico history that provides new insight into the trans-regional history of the state.

The course does not assume any history research skills nor technical knowledge.


## Student Learning Outcomes
- Think critically about how history is produced, disseminated, and consumed in the digital age.
- Appreciate the theoretical possibilities and practical limitations of digital archives and new research and publishing technologies.
- Begin to experiment with new tools, workflows, methods, and techniques for large-scale research questions in history.


## Work Requirements and Grading
- Thorough preparedness and engaged participation in most every class meeting. This is a class that's focused on discussing and making things, not just memorizing and regurgitating a historical narrative. (30%)
- Digitization of one box (TBD) of archival material (10%)
- Mini-essay on one historical source (a warm-up for the final) (10%)
- Participation in all peer review activities (10%)
- Historical Essay on a topic related to AMH archives (40%)
    - Lots more detail on the components of this will be covered later

While I try to provide feedback on the various assignments throughout the semester, I heartily encourage you to speak with me at any time to learn what I think of your performance in the class and how it can be improved (if at all).
