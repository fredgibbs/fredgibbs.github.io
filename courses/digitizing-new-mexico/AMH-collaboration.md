This document, perhaps a very rough draft for a memorandum of understanding, seeks to formalize a relationship between Acequia Madre House and the History Department at the University of New Mexico.

The course, _Digital Futures of History_, is a upper-level undergraduate course that teaches students about the process of digitizing archives, historical research, and facilitates archival work or historical research of interest to AMH. It draws from contemporary readings in history, public history, historiography, digital humanities, literary studies, media studies, and library and museum studies.

This course also partnerships with cultural heritage institutions This course presents students with a unique opportunity to directly engage with digital archival practices, historical research with an unpublished archive, and experience with creating digital essays for the web.


The first iteration of the course will take place in Spring 2019. Using this as a pilot run, we'll be able to determine the feasibility and value of continuing the partnership between AMH and UNM in future semesters. As long as enrollments remain reasonable, the course could be offered once per year. There is no obligation for AMH to integrate with the course each time it is offered. But when there is important work to be done with the archives at AMH, it could be useful for supervised students to help complete that work and gain hands-on experience with historical archives and research practices.

The principal instructor for the course is Dr. Frederick Gibbs, a recognized leader in digital humanities research and pedagogy. He has been teaching digital history courses at various levels and offering workshops and seminars in digital research methods since 2009.
