# Visual Essay Instructions
This guide provides the formal requirements and instructions for your Markdown critiques. The basic idea is the same as your original, with a few technological enhancements.

## Basic Requirements
- Written in plain text using Markdown for formatting (Duh)
  - Remember to save your file with a .md extension
- At least 4 screenshots of the website you're reviewing. You will upload the images to the appropriate GitHub folder, and link to them in your Markdown document
- Judicious use of subheadings to delineate your main topics
- ~800 words, but the quality is far more important than the quantity
- All images and your essays need to be uploaded to the appropriate folder in our GitHub repository

## Tips from last time
- Leave time to revise your essays and eliminate simplistic and inefficient prose.
- Avoid writing a 'process narrative'---that is, a description of "First I clicked this, then I clicked that, but it didn't work, so I clicked something else." **Nobody cares what you clicked on**.
- Don't miss the forest for the trees. Whatever your particular experience may have been, you should always remember that people reading your review are looking for the big picture (the forest), not particular details.


## Goals of critiques
- Make it clear what the goals of the project are
- Provide some summary of the main features / functionality
- Evaluate how well the various facets of the website facilitate those goals (design, organization, writing style, etc)
- How appropriate is the style for the intended audience?
- Make a note of aspects that failed badly
- Make a note of aspects that worked well
- Remember to incorporate our readings from earlier in the semester (_yes in fact there was a reason we read all those pieces_)
  - In particular, think about how maps, databases, interfaces, shape the kinds of interpretations the website is meant to facilitate.
- Most important: Organize your critiques by the particular points you want to make (this helps you avoid a rambling or process-narrative critique).
  - Give at least specific example to illustrate your point
