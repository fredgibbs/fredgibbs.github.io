# Spatial History Guide to ABQ
This guide provides the formal requirements and instructions for your spatial history assignment that you'll be researching and writing over our mid-semester break. As discussed, you'll pick a particular piece of public art or historic building in ABQ or on campus that holds some interest for them. You can consult this [a list of options](historic-places), so you don't have to find one yourself, but you can do something you already know about as well.

To embody what we read in the Wilson and Hayden chapters, we'll create small multi-media essays about some artwork or building, the circumstances of its creation, public discussion---and provide a richer sense of ABQ's cultural spaces. This project will demonstrate what digital history can and should be, as well as critically reflect on the challenges in moving from analog archives to digital presentations.

## What to do over break
Over break you'll focus on digital research; later in the term we'll talk about using traditional archives to round out your research. Your job during our extended break is to suss out everything you can online about it. Later, weâ€™ll do more work in the actual archives later and talk about the difference between the digital and the physical archives. Doing the web stuff first will give you more research ideas and leads for the archive.

## Things you should be doing
- Learn about artist/architect
- Find similar works
- Learn a little about the style (this isn't an art history course, but some background is always nice)
- Find discussions surrounding its construction/installation (think of the Holocaust Memorial downtown or the Zimmerman library murals)
- Feel free to Google around, but be systematic and document your process so it's reproducible!
- Start drafting your essay (bullets or something similar)
- Think about how you can incorporate the readings into your essay

## Formatting Requirements
- Written in plain text using Markdown for formatting
- 3 historical photographs (at least---more is better!)
- 3 modern photographs, panoramas, or similar
- Judicious use of subheadings to delineate your main topics
- ~800 words, but the quality is far more important than the quantity


## Goals of essays
- We talked about the lack any kind of spatial or cultural guide to ABW, so we're taking a step to improve that.
- Remember that these essays are a kind of critique---namely how space is used to build community through cultural memory.
- Put your art or building in SPACE! Remember how descriptions of cultural artifacts are so frequently devoid of space.
  - This means that you won't be talking only about the art or monument or building, but what it did to the space in which it was built/installed and how that relationship and meaning has changed over time.
