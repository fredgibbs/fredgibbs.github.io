# Spatial History Guide to ABQ
This guide provides the formal requirements and instructions for your spatial history assignment. As discussed, you'll pick a particular piece of public art or historic building in ABQ or on campus that holds some interest for you. You can consult this [a list of options](historic-places), so you don't have to find one yourself, but you can do something you already know about as well.

To embody what we read in the Wilson and Hayden chapters, we'll create small multi-media essays about some artwork or building, the circumstances of its creation, its surroundsing, and provide a richer sense of ABQ's cultural spaces. This project will demonstrate what digital history can and should be, as well as help us critically reflect on the challenges in moving from analog archives to digital presentations.

## Style
- Write something you'd like to read
- Aim for informal sophistication
- Demonstrate your expertise through description AND analysis
- Compose informative topic sentences that provide a clear progression through the essay

## Formatting Requirements
- Written in plain text using Markdown for formatting
- 3 historical photographs (at least---more is better!)
- 3 modern photographs, panoramas, or similar
- Subheadings to delineate your main topics
- No set length requirement since initial drafts; make sure essay achieves it goals instead of worrying about word counts.


## Essay Requirements
- **Citations**. Along with the analysis contained in your essay, citations are the primary indication of the breadth and depth of your research. You should have at least 5 original historical sources and 5 secondary sources. You should list relevant websites, but not count them as official sources. Your research must be your own.
- **Engaging writing**, engaging the above questions, with minimal use of passive voice.
- **Images with descriptive captions**. Use images not merely as eye candy, but to visually communicate the main points of your story.
- **Clearly stated goal/relevance** for each section (see questions above).
- **Meaningful headings** that provide clear structure and ideally communicate main points.
- **Pull quotes** used appropriate to call attention to your best ideas.
- **Consistent use of bold and italics**. Don't use either too often; you'll negate the effect of highlighting something. Do not use either for references; leave those as unformatted text.

## Citations
For inline citations, we will use author date notation (Smith 1975, 13). **Do not cite webpages as primary sources! Find the original historical source, and cite that instead.** If you need to respond to something on a webpage (because you found something particulary good or bad to highlight), then, and only then, should you cite the webpage. You won't have a page number, but you'll still have author and date. If you can't find a date, use "n.d." (for no date).

Be as specific and consistent as you can with your citations, even though some of your historical sources may require some improvising.

## Sources
At the end of your essay, you should list the full bibliographic entry for your source to complement the inline citations that appear in the text. Use an second-level heading that says "Sources" (with no colon) at the top of this section.

## Image Credits
Provide descriptive phrases for your captions, and use the first few words as a "key" that you can use in your Image Credits section (also a second-level heading). Do not use images that you don't have permission to use. As with in-text references, you must provide detailed citations to your image source. This means that you cannot simply reuse an image you've found online unless you have a specific reference for it.

## Section Headings
Do not use **bold** in your headings; use an appropriate heading level (as shown below). We can create new styles if need be. For your reference, all the headings styles are demonstrated below. Remember that you must have a space between the ### and the actual heading!

## Goals of essays
- We talked about the lack any kind of spatial or cultural guide to ABQ, so we're taking a step to improve that.
- Remember that these essays are a kind of critique---namely how space is used to build community through cultural memory.
- Put your art or building in SPACE! Remember how descriptions of cultural artifacts are so frequently devoid of space.
  - This means that you won't be talking only about the art or monument or building, but what it did to the space in which it was built/installed and how that relationship and meaning has changed over time.

## Questions to keep in mind
- Who is our audience?
- What do they know?
- What do we want them to know?
- How do we want them to think differently?

## What to do over break
Over break you'll focus on digital research; later in the term we'll talk about using traditional archives to round out your research. Your job during our extended break is to suss out everything you can online about it. Later, weâ€™ll do more work in the actual archives later and talk about the difference between the digital and the physical archives. Doing the web stuff first will give you more research ideas and leads for the archive.

- Learn about artist/architect
- Find similar works
- Learn a little about the style (this isn't an art history course, but some background is always nice)
- Find discussions surrounding its construction/installation (think of the Holocaust Memorial downtown or the Zimmerman library murals)
- Feel free to Google around, but be systematic and document your process so it's reproducible!
- Start drafting your essay (bullets or something similar)
- Think about how you can incorporate the readings into your essay
