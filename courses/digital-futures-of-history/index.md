## Course Description
This interdisciplinary course explores the effects of the digital age on producing and consuming history. Some guiding questions:

- How are historians adapting research and publication practices to use digitized archives and historical data?
- How does technology shape our access to the past?
- How does the Web change the kinds and forms of history that should be produced?
- How does the Web (and resources like Wikipedia) change perceptions of history?
- How can historians engage with these methods to improve information literacy?

In addressing these questions, we'll draw from contemporary readings in history, public history, historiography, digital humanities, literary studies, media studies, and library and museum studies. Along with our readings, we will investigate a variety of digital history, archival, and journalistic projects that feature various digital methods (such as text analysis, mapping, data visualization, and so on). We’ll critique the various facets of these projects (data, design, interface, utility, etc.) to understand the technologies and data involved. Based on this work, we’ll collaboratively design and publish a website that showcases our rigorous reviews of these digital projects.


## Student Learning Outcomes
- Think critically about how history is produced, disseminated, and consumed in the digital age.
- Understand the theoretical possibilities and practical limitations of digital archives and new research and publishing technologies.
- Begin to experiment with new tools, workflows, methods, and techniques for large-scale research questions in history.
- Identify cultural and algorithmic biases in searching for historical information

## Work Requirements and Grading
- Thorough preparedness and engaged participation in most every class meeting. This is a class that's focused on discussing and making things, not just memorizing and regurgitating a historical narrative. (35%)
- Spatial history research project (15%)
- 2 ~750-word critiques of digital history/humanities projects (20%)
- 2 Peer critiques (of the above critiques) (10%)
- 2 ~5-minute video website reviews. We'll spend time in class discussing how to make these. But yes, they are videos, not written reviews. (20%)

While I try to provide feedback throughout the semester, particularly on the various assignments, I heartily encourage you to speak with me at any time to learn what I think of your performance in the class and how it can be improved (if at all).


## Books
The following books are required for the course, but they are not available at UNM bookstore. They are widely available online in whatever condition you desire.

- Keith Jenkins, _Rethinking History_ 3rd. ed. ISBN: 978-0415304436 [amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Rethinking-History-Routledge-Classics-96/dp/0415304431/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1483304717).
- Ellen Lupton, _Thinking with Type_ 2nd. ed. ISBN: 978-1568989693 [amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Type-2nd-revised-expanded/dp/1568989695).

Note that there is a [Thinking with Type website](http://thinkingwithtype.com), but it DOES NOT substitute for the book itself, which has a tremendous amount of essential content that the website does not (not surprisingly). Browse the website if you'd like (it's nicely done), but READ THE BOOK.

You will also need to subscribe to the course Zotero library to access assigned articles. This will be discussed in class, but for reference, please see the [instructions for connecting](http://fredgibbs.net/courses/etc/zotero.html).
