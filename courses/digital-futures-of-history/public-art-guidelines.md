# Public Art Essay Instructions
This guide provides the formal requirements and instructions for your public art assignment that you'll be researching and writing over our mid-semester break.

## Formatting Requirements
- Written in plain text using Markdown for formatting
- 4 screenshots of the website you're reviewing
- Judicious use of subheadings to delineate your main topics
- ~800 words, but the quality is far more important than the quantity

## Tips from last time
- Leave time to revise your essays and eliminate simplistic and inefficient prose.
- Avoid writing out a 'process narrative'---that is, a description of "First I clicked this, then I clicked that, but it didn't work, so I clicked something else."
- Don't miss the forest for the trees. Whatever your particular experience may have been, you should always remember that people reading your review are looking for the big picture (the forest), not particular details.
-

## Goals of critiques
- Make it clear what the goals of the project are
- Evaluate how well the various facets of the website facilitate those goals (design, organization, writing style, etc)
