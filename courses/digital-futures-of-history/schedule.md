# IN PROGRESS!

## 9: Spatial History Work Time

(Oct 17 and 19): NO CLASS
READ: Ellen Lupton, _Thinking with Type_ (2nd edition).

{% include alert.html class='warning' title='No class: Research Break' text="
During this week, you'll work on a local spatial history research project. The idea (which we'll refine together as the date gets closer) is that everyone will pick a particular piece of public art in ABQ or on campus that holds some interest for them (I'll supply a list of options, so you don't have to find one yourself, but you can do something you already know about as well). Using local archives, especially the Center for Southwest Research in Zimmerman Library, we'll create small multi-media essays about art, the circumstances of its creation, public discussion---and, of course, critique. We'll discuss all the processes and requirements before fall break so you'll know exactly what to do. But it does take time, which is why you get a week to work on it.
