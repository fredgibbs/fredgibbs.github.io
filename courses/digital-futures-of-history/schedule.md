# IN PROGRESS!

## 9: Spatial History Work Time

(Oct 17 and 19): NO CLASS
READ: Ellen Lupton, _Thinking with Type_ (2nd edition).

{% include alert.html class='warning' title='No class: Research Break' text="
During this week, you'll pair up to research and work on a local spatial history research project. The idea (which we'll refine together as the date gets closer) is that everyone will pick a particular historic site or monument in ABQ that holds some interest for them. Using historic maps, newspapers, and city archives, we'll create micro-histories of these spaces, and then look at how they help shape the city as a whole and how they illustrate the story of ABQ's development over time. We'll discuss all the processes and requirements before fall break so you'll know exactly what to do. But it does take time, which is why you get a week to work on it.
