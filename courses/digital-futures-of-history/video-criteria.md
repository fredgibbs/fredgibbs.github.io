# Video Critique Shore Sheet
The are two main components to your video review, as outlined below: the review and video component

## Review Component
Same review goals as the [critique writing guide](markdown-critiques) you used before (see the GOALS section at the bottom). The main difference, obviously, is that you are using the video to evaluate and critique the functionality of the site---which would be totally inefficient to describe in words.


## Video component

### Audio
Clean-sounding audio
Efficient script (no rambling, mumbling, etc)
No screen narration (saying what you are obviously doing in the video)
No wild volume discrepancies between talks


### Video
Clear purpose to what you're recording
No dead screen time
No waiting for pages to load or other delays
Mostly seamless editing between takes
Effective use of transition effects


### General
Assume viewers don't know anything about the site you're reviewing
Video should be accessible to a general audience
The visual and audio tracks complement rather than duplicate each other.
Efficiency! Make sure your videos don't stall
Energy: Keep viewers engaged
