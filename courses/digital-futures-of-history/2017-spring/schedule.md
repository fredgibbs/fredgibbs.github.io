# IN PROGRESS!
This syllabus is a living document and changes frequently, depending on what's going on in the course, though the general workload will remain more or less as indicated. If you print it out, you'll need to keep your paper version up to date with the online version.

### How do they read?
One of our goals is to think critically about how digital interfaces to historical interpretation changes the way we think about the past. This also includes examining the forms of the readings, particularly how the different layouts, typography, and writing style affects the way we interact with them. Please come to class prepared to discuss both form _and_ content.


## 1: Course Introduction

### Wednesday
Today we'll review the syllabus, course aims, assignments, and general plan for the semester. We'll also figure out how to customize the course to best suit participants' interests.


## 2: Ethos of Digital History / Humanities

### Monday
William Cronon, [The Public Practice of History in and for a Digital Age](http://www.historians.org/perspectives/issues/2012/1201/The-Public-Practice-of-History-in-and-for-a-Digital-Age.cfm).

Lisa Spiro, ["This Is Why We Fight": Defining the Values of the Digital Humanities](http://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/debates/text/13).

### Wednesday
Stephen Ramsay, [DH Types One and Two](http://stephenramsay.us/2013/05/03/dh-one-and-two/).

Mark Sample, [The Digital Humanities Is Not About Building, It’s About Sharing](http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:IyRYK7RWT8cJ:www.samplereality.com/2011/05/25/the-digital-humanities-is-not-about-building-its-about-sharing/+&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us).

Peruse and come prepared to discuss some the sites listed [here](http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_vault/2016/12/30/five_great_digital_history_projects_from_2016.html) (and also briefly survey some of the past projects (links near the top) to get a historical perspective), and [here](http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_vault/2017/01/05/some_of_the_most_browsable_history_sites_we_encountered_in_2016.html).

You don't need to spend a lot of time on each site, but you should be familiar with their purpose and functionality, as well as what you think they do well and not so well. Do they embrace the kind of digital humanities we read about for Monday?

In following up the possibility of doing a Diag history, it seems oddly difficult to find much. The [Wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Diag), the first search result, largely ignores its history; a tantalizingly named but not all that helpful [history](https://heritage.umich.edu/stories/a-different-diag/), might be a model for something we make. This could be a demanding but fun project that would give us hands-on experience with many (not overly technical) digital skills, and be of wide interest to the community.

Be sure to click through this [UM History site](http://umhistory.org/history/index.html), and think about how we might contribute to or improve on that effort. I didn't find much on the diag in this, either.

### Wednesday
No new readings! Focus on completing drafts of your essays that showcase your research so far, and start to present a story that we can publish on our website. Come to class prepared to discuss your essay and research behind it; you'll give a brief presentation/overview of what you've learned so far and where you're headed with your research. We'll critique each other's work based on advice from the readings for (last) Monday; we'll also spend some time discussing the readings in general.


## 7: Rethinking Campus Histories

### Monday
Google 'campus history' and see what turns up (find somewhere other than Michigan). It's a mixed bag. Find something that intrigues you (it doesn't have to be on the first page). Write a ~800 word critique of the project, following the advice of the articles from last week.

#### Questions:
- What themes are most compelling?
- What kinds of stories will be useful?
- What kinds of layout/design are we going to use? Why?
- What kinds of typography?


#### We need to set our research agenda TODAY:
- Everyone will write 3 ~1000 word essays on 3 different themes (hopefully related, maybe not).
- Have a clear point and original contribution
- Develop clear chronology and topography in your essays
- Find / create ~6 images to support each essay (mostly from Bentley)
- Link to other essays (both ours an existing online histories)
- Use pull quotes to highlight information


### Wednesday
Research Day: No Class; use time for Bentley visit
