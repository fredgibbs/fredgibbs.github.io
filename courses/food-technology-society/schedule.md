# Schedule of Readings and Assignments

## 1: Introductions

### Jan 17 (MLK)

### Jan 19
We'll review the course aims, assignments, and general plan for the semester. We'll also discuss the problematic concept of "natural food" as a way of considering some key issues we'll be discussing throughout the semester.


### Jan 21
Today we're looking at a couple of very different takes on the necessity and utility of food science. Why are these so different? Where do such divergent views come from?

- Melanie Warner, _Pandora's Lunchbox_, xiii--xix; 1--20 (Weird Science). What does Warner think of food technology? How are economies of scale intimately tied to our understanding of natural food? What are key transportation developments that influenced what and how we eat? What's the difference between food grown in the ground and food produced in the lab? Does all food boil down to chemistry?

- [What is a Natural Food](https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2016/05/08/477057872/what-is-natural-food-a-riddle-wrapped-in-notions-of-good-and-evil). Is the idea of natural food essentially a moral judgement about how much technology should or should not be applied to food? Can any clear demarcation between



## 2: Improving Nature

### Feb 2
Today we're looking at how a technology like canning---that seems obviously useful and safe now---was viewed with a lot of skepticism. This chapter shows how a main obstacle to selling food in cans was not trouble with canning technology itself, but in building consumer trust.

### Mar 30
- Wendee Nicole, "Secret Ingredients", _Environmental Health Perspectives_ 121.6 (2013): A126--A133. This article is about food additives and the sketchy regulations (and the uses of science) that govern them and their safety.

There's a quote in the article: "_Whether a food ingredient is GRAS (Generally Recognized As Safe) depends on the general recognition of safety, not on safety per se_". What does that really mean? How is this claim supported in the article?


### Apr 1
{% include alert.html class='danger' title='DUE: Executive Summary' text="
Drawing widely from this week's readings, submit an [Executive Summary](exec-summary-guide) on the place of 'secret' ingredients in convenience foods and what the role of federal regulation should be. I'm NOT asking you to simply summarize the readings, but to use them as a basis for a more philosophical piece on food additives generally.

Questions to consider, but please don't try to answer all of these: What kinds of things should be allowed in our food? What is the role of regulation? How can it be enforced? How precise should labeling be? What are the problems with full transparency? How do we assess risk of food additives?

### Apr 4
- Green Revolution Reading
- Michael Pollan, _Omnivore's Dilemma_ (Ch. 2: The Farm), 32--56.

### Apr 8
- Warren Belasco, _Appetite for Change_, 29--42 (Radical Consumerism); 111--131 (War of the Metaphors).



## 13: Standardizing Organic
Isn't it weird that at least culturally speaking we have two fundamental categories of food--organic and non-organic? What does that say about our food system and our expectations for food? Our discussion about organic food isn't as directly about technology as some of our other topics, but I contend that we can't talk productively about organic practices, definitions, labeling, certification, etc, unless we think about the issue in the context of the various ways in which technology and food have a very complicated relationship (that we have been trying to untangle a bit in this course).

### Apr 11
- Michael Pollan, _Omnivore's Dilemma_ (Ch. 9: Big Organic), 134--184.


### Apr 13
- Laura B. DeLind, “Transforming Organic Agriculture into Industrial Organic Products: Reconsidering National Organic Standards,” 198–-208.

### Apr 15
{% include alert.html class='danger' title='DUE: Executive Summary' text="
Prepare an executive summary that addresses this question: How does the history of food and technology help us understand the future of organics? There is NO RIGHT ANSWER. I'm interested in how much you can bring the course to bear on this question, however you choose to do that. Be sure to consult the [Executive Summary Writing Guide](exec-summary-guide).

Consult the [website analysis guide](website-analysis-guide) for more details.

The best essays will draw together various themes from the course and makes extensive use of the Jenkins reading.

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='DUE: Week in Review' text="
Both articles obviously have the relationship between food and technology at their core, and both make excellent points. But I hope after this class you'll be able to recognize how both are a bit myopic in terms of how they discuss technology.

Regarding whichever article you read:
- What are the key issues, or basic questions or challenges discussed in the article?
- What assumptions does it make about technological \"progress\"?
- Explain, drawing from previous course readings, what key aspects about food and technology are MISSING from the article that should have been touched on a bit more to develop a more thorough analysis of the key issues?
