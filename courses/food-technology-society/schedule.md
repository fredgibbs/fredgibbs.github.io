## 1: Introductions

### Jan 17 (MLK)

### Jan 19
We'll review the course aims, assignments, and general plan for the semester. We'll also discuss the problematic concept of "natural food" as a way of considering some key issues we'll be discussing throughout the semester.

You don't need to read this before class, but we'll be discussing: [Feeding the World Today and Tomorrow: The Importance of Food Science and Technology](https://ift.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1541-4337.2010.00127.x).


### Jan 21
Many topics we cover in this course speak to (but do not answer) the complex question: What is a natural food? Does the application of technology to food make it less natural? We often see "natural" as descriptors of food in grocery stores and restaurant menus, but what does that mean? Can anything be natural anymore? Do we really want natural food, anyway?

- Melanie Warner, _Pandora's Lunchbox_, xiii--xix; 1--20 (Weird Science). What does Warner think of food technology? What would she consider a natural food?

- Joseph LaPorte, [What are natural foods?](https://aeon.co/essays/is-eating-natural-food-the-same-as-eating-whats-healthy).

- [The Family Oracle of Health](https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Family_Oracle_of_Health_Or_Magazine/K-oEAAAAQAAJ?hl=en&gbpv=0) (1824), bottom 64--top 68 (the section on the "natural food of man").

Is the idea of natural food essentially a moral judgement about how much technology should or should not be applied to food? Can any clear demarcation between

## 2: Improving Nature
As the U.S. industrialized and urbanized rapidly throughout the 19th century, many people got further away from their food and started buying a lot more of it. This week we look at how developments in urbanization, transportation, and food production touted how much they were improving nature. In the cases of meat extract and cereal, we see how a main goal was make it more digestible than the natural, raw product. Food ads from the turn of the century show how producers began to claim how they were both capturing and improving nature, a theme we still see today in every aisle of the grocery store.

"%}


## 3: Unnatural Trust
As cities grew, so did the amount of food that city-dwellers had to purchase. But it was a major shift for people to buy food that came in an opaque can or box. A technology like canning---that seems obviously useful and safe now---was viewed with a lot of skepticism. As a result, the idea of a name brand that consumers (think Borden, Heinz, etc) could trust regardless of the product became central to food production and marketing.

## 4: Pure Food
As food production and many food products themselves became hidden from consumers, unscrupulous manufacturers would cut almost any corner to lower their costs by using various fillers and misleading consumers as to what was inside the box. In addition, the growth of food chemistry meant that many new chemicals could be added to food to enhance shelf-life and stability. This week we see, as a result of rapid technological change, the debates about the necessity (or not) of government to regulate food manufacturers to ensure purity and honesty.

## 5: Pure and Modern Milk
This week we're learning to read quickly and extract the main point from a food book. The main topic is how the production and distribution and consumption of milk changed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries as cities grew in size (both demographically and physically), pushing dairy farms farther from cities and also needing to scale up. We'll see how a lot of what we take for granted with milk---as a natural, wholesome, and safe food---has a surprisingly contested history behind it. The story behind milk perfectly illustrates the themes of the last few weeks in terms of how technology was employed to make "pure" food by improving nature.


### Feb 14
- Kendra Smith-Howard, _Pure and Modern Milk_, 1--11; 12--35; 36--66.

### Feb 16
- Kendra Smith-Howard, _Pure and Modern Milk_, 67--97.

### Feb 18
NO CLASS!

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Book Review' text="
How does the story of how milk production and distribution is changing illustrate the intersection of food, technology, and society?
"%}



## 6: Industrializing Food
Continuing with the same theme as milk, this week we look at how farms became more like factories in the early 20th century. We also look in particular at the drive to industrialize animals to scale up production and lower costs.

### Feb 21
- Deborah Fitzgerald, [_Every Farm a Factory: The Industrial Ideal in American Agriculture_](http://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/unm/detail.action?docID=3419843), 10--32.

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='DUE: QUIZ' text="
Same quiz routine as always. Be sure to complete the quiz by midnight or let me know what your plan is.

## 7: Cold War Cooking
This week brings us two somewhat paradoxical and concurrent trends: the development of refrigeration to have fresher food and frozen foods that were anything but fresh, but very convenient. You might think given the ubiquity of both of these now, that it was an inevitable development of technology. But we'll look at how contested the growth of these were and how they refigured the American kitchen.


{% include alert.html class='warning' title='Read Quickly' text="
There are three big chunks of reading for this week, but they all go fast. Challenge yourself to read quickly without skipping big chunks. We'll address the main points in class, so all you need to do is have a broad familiarity with what the readings are trying to outline. There is a lot of historical detail to support the authors' claims, which is easy to skim once you've got the main idea.

### Mar 2
I don't expect you to read 80 pages for one day of class, but we're going to talk about the whole book as preparation for your review due on Friday. At a minimum, you should be able to read the first chapter carefully and skim the second. You'll have time to review them later while you're writing your review. This is much less dense than the milk book, so it's a pretty quick read and we can cover it in a single day. And to practice reading quickly is part of reason for the exercises.

- Laura Shapiro, _Something from the Oven_, 3--40.
- Laura Shapiro, _Something from the Oven_, 41--84.


### Mar 4
NO CLASS!

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='DUE: Book Review' text="
How do these do chapters illustrate how technology is impacting cooking at home?

FLEX DEADLINE: Book reviews are technically due today, per our usual routine, but as we're all in survival mode at this point in the semester, you can submit your book review anytime in the next week.
"%}



## 8: Sweetness and Risk
This week is about how technology in food creates new concerns and debates about risk. We've already seen in the pure food week how food could be risky from a health standpoint when left purely to capitalist markets. But this week we look at the intersection of scientific understandings of risk versus public perception of them.

### Mar 7
- Carolyn Thomas Peña, _Empty Pleasure_ (Ch. 1), 13--38.

### Mar 9
- Carolyn Thomas Peña, _Empty Pleasure_ (Ch. 5), 141--175; (Conclusion), 219--228.

## 9: Mar 14, 16, 18: SPRING BREAK


## 10: Mar 21, 23, 25: MORE BREAK, SORT OF.
No class this week! But you do have a (post) midterm, due midnight on Friday, that wraps-up the first half and gets us primed for the second half.

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='DUE FRIDAY: First Half Reflection' text="
How would YOU describe the story of food, technology, and society so far? What commonalities do you see between the various topics and readings? What's been most and least interesting so far? AND WHY?!

**As always with reflections, there is no right answer!!!** I'm looking for you to show off what you've learned and a serious effort to describe and link the key themes of the course. This is our way of getting back into the course after a much-needed break.
"%}


## 11: Risky Ingredients
Continuing the theme of risk, this week we look at the modern state of food additives and the intersection of food safety and food technology. What would Harvey Wiley think of all this stuff in our food?

### Mar 28
- Melanie Warner, _Pandora's Lunchbox_ (Ch. 6: Better living through chemistry), 97--123 .
- Steve Ettlinger, _Twinkie, Deconstructed_ (Ch. 4: Enrichment Blend), 29--44.


### Mar 30
- Wendee Nicole, "Secret Ingredients", _Environmental Health Perspectives_ 121.6 (2013): A126--A133. This article is about food additives and the sketchy regulations (and the uses of science) that govern them and their safety.

There's a quote in the article: "_Whether a food ingredient is GRAS (Generally Recognized As Safe) depends on the general recognition of safety, not on safety per se_". What does that really mean? How is this claim supported in the article?


### Apr 1
{% include alert.html class='info' title='IN CLASS' text="
We'll be discussing the readings and walking through how to do executive summaries.

What kinds of things should be allowed in our food? What is the role of regulation? How can it be enforced? How precise should labeling be? What are the problems with full transparency? How do we assess risk of food additives?
"%}

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='DUE: Executive Summary' text="
Drawing widely from this week's readings, submit an [Executive Summary](exec-summary-guide) on the place of 'secret' ingredients in convenience foods and what the role of federal regulation should be. DO NOT simply summarize the readings! Use them as a basis for a more philosophical piece on food additives generally.

Questions to consider (as we did in class), but please don't try to answer all of these: What kinds of things should be allowed in our food? What is the role of regulation? How can it be enforced? How precise should labeling be? What are the problems with full transparency? How do we assess risk of food additives?
"%}



## 12: Environmental Food
It was only about 60 years ago that we really started to think about the environmental implications of the incredibly rapid rise of food technology and production. We also learn about Rachel Carson, one of the few people in history that we can point to as almost single-handedly changing the way we think about the environment and helped to create the field of ecology.

- Rachel Carson, _Silent Spring_, 5--13; 15--37.



## 13: Standardizing Organic
Isn't it weird that at least culturally speaking we have two fundamental categories of food---organic and non-organic? What does that say about our food system and our expectations for food? Our discussion about organic food isn't as directly about technology as some of our other topics, but I contend that we can't talk productively about organic practices, definitions, labeling, certification, etc, unless we think about the issue in the context of the various ways in which technology and food have a very complicated relationship (that we have been trying to untangle a bit in this course).

## 14: GMOs
Perhaps no issue more than Genetically Modified Organisms embodies the various themes we've explored in the course thus far. This week we focus on the various issues of food technology that get rarified with the debate about the safety, risk, regulation, and labeling of GMO foods.

### Apr 29
TBD (or no class)


## 16: Fake Meat and Food Futures
Mostly wrap-up stuff for our last two meetings. Monday continues our theme of thinking through the social implications of technological change when it comes to food production and consumption, and how new advancements are challenging traditional categories of food. Should lab-grown meat be labeled as meat? Or is that deceptive?

According to the Poinski, how is technology presenting challenges for food labeling? There isn't much historical context in the article, but how can histories like that of protose help us?
