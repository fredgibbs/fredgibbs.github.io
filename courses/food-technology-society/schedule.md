# Schedule of Readings and Assignments

## Decoding the syllabus
- Regular bullet points listed under each day is what you need to READ BEFORE CLASS.

{% include alert.html class='info' title='Blue boxes' text="
These indicate what we'll be doing or discussing in class, sometimes with additional links for reference. If there is no blue box for one of our meeting days, there's just a usual class discussion, so no need for a special box.

## 1: Introductions

### Jan 17 (MLK)

### Jan 19
We'll review the course aims, assignments, and general plan for the semester. We'll also discuss the problematic concept of "natural food" as a way of considering some key issues we'll be discussing throughout the semester.


### Jan 21
Today we're looking at a couple of very different takes on the necessity and utility of food science. Why are these so different? Where do such divergent views come from?

- Melanie Warner, _Pandora's Lunchbox_, xiii--xix; 1--20 (Weird Science). What does Warner think of food technology? How are economies of scale intimately tied to our understanding of natural food? What are key transportation developments that influenced what and how we eat? What's the difference between food grown in the ground and food produced in the lab? Does all food boil down to chemistry?

- [What is a Natural Food](https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2016/05/08/477057872/what-is-natural-food-a-riddle-wrapped-in-notions-of-good-and-evil). Is the idea of natural food essentially a moral judgement about how much technology should or should not be applied to food? Can any clear demarcation between



## 2: Improving Nature

### Jan 31

### Feb 4

## 5: Milk
This week we're learning to read quickly and extract the main point from a food book. The main topic is how the production and distribution and consumption of milk changed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries as cities grew in size (both demographically and physically), pushing dairy farms farther from cities and needing to scale up.

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='DUE: First Half Reflection' text="
No class today, but you should submit your First Half Reflection by midnight.

How would YOU describe the story of food, technology, and society so far? What commonalities do you see between the various topics and readings? What's been most and least interesting so far? AND WHY?! As always with reflections, there is no right answer!!! I'm looking for you to show off what you've learned and a serious effort to describe and link the key themes of the course.

### Mar 30
- Wendee Nicole, "Secret Ingredients", _Environmental Health Perspectives_ 121.6 (2013): A126--A133. This article is about food additives and the sketchy regulations (and the uses of science) that govern them and their safety.

There's a quote in the article: "_Whether a food ingredient is GRAS (Generally Recognized As Safe) depends on the general recognition of safety, not on safety per se_". What does that really mean? How is this claim supported in the article?


### Apr 1
{% include alert.html class='info' title='IN CLASS' text="
Executive summary prep: What kinds of things should be allowed in our food? What is the role of regulation? How can it be enforced? How precise should labeling be? What are the problems with full transparency? How do we assess risk of food additives?

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='DUE: Executive Summary' text="
Drawing widely from this week's readings, submit an [Executive Summary](exec-summary-guide) on the place of 'secret' ingredients in convenience foods and what the role of federal regulation should be. DO NOT simply summarize the readings! Use them as a basis for a more philosophical piece on food additives generally.

Questions to consider, but please don't try to answer all of these: What kinds of things should be allowed in our food? What is the role of regulation? How can it be enforced? How precise should labeling be? What are the problems with full transparency? How do we assess risk of food additives?
"%}

### Apr 4
- Green Revolution Reading
- Michael Pollan, _Omnivore's Dilemma_ (Ch. 2: The Farm), 32--56.

### Apr 8
- Warren Belasco, _Appetite for Change_, 29--42 (Radical Consumerism); 111--131 (War of the Metaphors).



## 13: Standardizing Organic
Isn't it weird that at least culturally speaking we have two fundamental categories of food--organic and non-organic? What does that say about our food system and our expectations for food? Our discussion about organic food isn't as directly about technology as some of our other topics, but I contend that we can't talk productively about organic practices, definitions, labeling, certification, etc, unless we think about the issue in the context of the various ways in which technology and food have a very complicated relationship (that we have been trying to untangle a bit in this course).

### Apr 11
- Michael Pollan, _Omnivore's Dilemma_ (Ch. 9: Big Organic), 134--184.


### Apr 13
- Laura B. DeLind, “Transforming Organic Agriculture into Industrial Organic Products: Reconsidering National Organic Standards,” 198–-208.

### Apr 15
{% include alert.html class='danger' title='DUE: Executive Summary' text="
Prepare an executive summary that addresses this question: How does the history of food and technology help us understand the future of organics? There is NO RIGHT ANSWER. I'm interested in how much you can bring the course to bear on this question, however you choose to do that. Be sure to consult the [Executive Summary Writing Guide](exec-summary-guide).

Consult the [website analysis guide](website-analysis-guide) for more details. As with all your assignments, the goal is to put the course to use in addressing 'real-world' discussions about the impact of technology on food safety, quality, and risk. The best essays will draw together various themes from the course and makes extensive use of the Jenkins reading.

According to Monday's article, how is technology presenting challenges for food labeling? There isn't much historical context in the article, but when have we seen similar issues arise in the past? History never supplies any answers, but how can the history of food + tech help us ask better questions or think more carefully about how to label foods generated with increasingly sophisticated tech?
