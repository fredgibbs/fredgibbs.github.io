# Schedule of Readings and Assignments


## General rules
- Regular bullet points listed under each day is what you need to READ BEFORE CLASS.
- Readings are listed in a particular order that I think works best.
- All work that isn't directly linked to is in [our Zotero library](https://www.zotero.org/groups/1647225/food-tech-society-unm/library). See the syllabus home page for instructions on gaining access.
- Submit all work via Learn (the discussion board) before midnight the day it's listed. Don't worry about a few minutes, but I expect to have them (and will start grading them) early the next morning.

## 1: Introductions

### Jan 17 (MLK)

### Jan 19
We'll review the course aims, assignments, and general plan for the semester. We'll also discuss the problematic concept of "natural food" as a way of considering some key issues we'll be discussing throughout the semester.

You don't need to read this before class, but we'll be briefly discussing: [Feeding the World Today and Tomorrow: The Importance of Food Science and Technology](https://ift.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1541-4337.2010.00127.x). If the website says you don't have access, you can find a PDF of the article in our Zotero Library.


### Jan 21
Many topics we cover in this course speak to (but do not answer) the complex question: What is a natural food? Does the application of technology to food make it less natural? We often see "natural" as descriptors of food in grocery stores and restaurant menus, but what does that mean? Can anything be natural anymore? Do we really want natural food, anyway?

- Melanie Warner, _Pandora's Lunchbox_, xiii--xix; 1--20 (Weird Science). What does Warner think of food technology? What would she consider a natural food? Do you agree with her definition of "processed" foods?

- Joseph LaPorte, [What are natural foods?](https://aeon.co/essays/is-eating-natural-food-the-same-as-eating-whats-healthy). This article discusses ways we should and should not define natural food, with a focus on the dangers of equating natural and healthy. This article is a great example of why thinking about definitions of natural food are important, especially in terms of how it affects thinking about ideas of health.

- [The Family Oracle of Health](https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Family_Oracle_of_Health_Or_Magazine/K-oEAAAAQAAJ?hl=en&gbpv=0) (1824), 62--64 (_On Vegetable Diet_); bottom 64--top 68 (_What is the Natural Food of Man_). Take a few minutes to skim the titles of the articles as you're scrolling to get to the readings--it's an eclectic mix! This is our first primary source, two very short letters to the editor from 1824 about what our natural diet should be. Writing style aside, the arguments sound like they could come from a diet book published last year.

#### Notable
- [What is a Natural Food](https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2016/05/08/477057872/what-is-natural-food-a-riddle-wrapped-in-notions-of-good-and-evil). Is the idea of natural food essentially a moral judgement about how much technology should or should not be applied to food? Can any clear demarcation between

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='DUE: QUIZ' text="
We have our first quiz this week! It's mostly a quiz on the syllabus to make sure we're clear on a few keys aspects of the class. There are a few questions related to Friday's reading and discussion as well.
"%}

## 2: Improving Nature
As the U.S. industrialized and urbanized rapidly throughout the 19th century, many people got further away from their food and started buying a lot more of it. This week we look at how developments in urbanization, transportation, and food production touted how much they were improving nature. In the cases of meat extract and cereal, we see how a main goal was make it more digestible than the natural, raw product. Food ads from the turn of the century show how producers began to claim how they were both capturing and improving nature, a theme we still see today in every aisle of the grocery store.

### Jan 24
- Jennifer Wallach, _How America Eats_ (Ch. 4: Technology and Taste), 89--105; skim 105--110.  This chapter is a great overview of some technological innovations in food production and provides a useful preview of many topics that we will cover in much more depth to understand the social side of technological change. How would you characterize the overall tone of this chapter in terms of how technology is portrayed?

#### Notable
- William Cronon, _Nature's Metropolis_ (Ch. 2: Rails and Water), 55--93.


### Jan 26
- _Medical Adviser_ 17 (1824), "Dyspepsia" (258 -- top of 260). Another _very_ short primary source for today! What is dyspepsia and why was it of such concern in the early 19th century?

- Lisa Haushofer, "Darby's Fluid Meat, Digestion, and the British Imperial Food Supply", 203--216. Why was fluid meat, which sounds kind of gross to our modern ears, so interesting in the middle of the 19th century? What was the key scientific debate between von Liebig and Pavy? How does it represent what's happening in general with food and science at the time?  

- Stephen Darby, [_On Fluid Meat_](https://archive.org/details/b22298344/mode/2up) (1870). Read the first few pages and skim the rest (it's really short) just to see Darby's own explanation for why his "new" preparation of meat is so valuable.


### Jan 28
- John Harvey Kellogg, [_The Stomach_](https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Stomach/98AmTp5YPmMC?hl=en&gbpv=1) (1896), 3--6 (the preface); 17--20 (The Chapter called "The Stomach"). Why is the stomach so important to Kellogg? How does this source give us important historical context for the advent of breakfast cereal?
- Nicholas Bauch, _A Geography of Digestion_ (Ch. 3: Flaked Cereal), 77--101  [both [ONLINE](http://libproxy.unm.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=nlebk&AN=1367888&site=ehost-live&scope=site&ebv=EB&ppid=pp_77) and in Zotero as a PDF] This book chapter describes Kellogg's discovery of how to make the flaked cereal that is ubiquitous today. The specific process of discovery isn't the main point, though, but how Kellogg saw his process of preparing cereal as an improvement or enhancement of nature. Food and health had become corrupted through society and technology---we needed a return to a more "natural" diet. Come to class prepared to share what YOU thought were most interesting points from the chapter (I intend to cycle through the notecards, not just rely on volunteers!)

- Week-in-Review Quiz Review (where we cover the hardest questions on the quiz so that they are easy for you later)
"%}

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='DUE: QUIZ' text="
After class, I will make the quiz available in Learn. It is due by midnight, but remember our policy for submitting work. Don't stress about being a few minutes or even hours late. But you do need to get in touch if you (or family) have medical issues that are keeping you from your work.

## 3: Unnatural Trust
As cities grew, so did the amount of food that city-dwellers had to purchase. But it was a major shift for people to buy food that came in an opaque can or box. A technology like canning---that seems obviously useful and safe now---was viewed with a lot of skepticism. As a result, the idea of a name brand that consumers (think Campbell's, Borden, Kellogg, Heinz, etc) could trust regardless of the product became central to food production and marketing.

### Jan 31
- Ann Vileisis, _Kitchen Literacy_, 96--125 (chap. 5: "A new longing for nature"). This reading Takes a broad view in describing our changing relationship to nature in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. There is a little repetition with stuff we saw last week, but just enough that it's a useful reminder of some key points. Last week we looked at technology improving nature, but today we read about how urban dwellers were interested in getting back to the "real" thing, and in particular how that affected the role of "nature" in early 20th century advertising. Appeals to nature were, as we've discussed, a way of gaining consumers' trust. They didn't need to worry about the details of the production process if they could be convinced that the food was natural, in spite of the rapidly-evolving technology used to produce it. As before, come to class prepared to discuss what you found most insightful or interesting or wrong.

{% include alert.html class='info' title='IN CLASS' text="
- Discussion and highlights of the article for today
- Cereal and Nature ads
- Quick look at [Maud Howe Elliot's article](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015012341577&view=1up&seq=104&skin=2021) (as mentioned in the reading).
- [Recreation Magazine (v. 7: 1902)](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Recreation/lPAXAAAAYAAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1) (skim and check out the \"Man Cannot Improve Nature\" ad on p. xliii).
"%}


### Feb 2
- Anna Zeide, _Canned_, 1--9; 10--30. Things to think about before class: What are the key points in the early history of canning (exact names and dates are not important for us)? How did canners respond to the idea of government regulation? How did canners try to convince consumers that canned good were safe and trustworthy? What does the rise of canned goods represent in the history of food, technology, and society?
- Anna Zeide, "Marion Harland, Tastemaker", 167--179. This short chapter reviews a little history of canning from the other reading for today, but is especially good at illustrating how consumer attitudes toward canning shifted in the early 20th century. We also see the importance of what we might call an early food celebrity in helping to influence consumer opinion.


### Feb 4
NO CLASS and NOTHING TO READ TODAY! Originally, we had Gabriella M. Petrick, "'Purity as Life: H.J. Heinz, religious sentiment, and the beginning of the industrial diet", 37--57.

As always, be sure to complete the quiz by midnight or let me know what your plan is. The quiz will be on the readings and discussions from Monday and Wednesday only, and should be available by Thursday afternoon.
"%}



## 4: Pure Food
As food production and many food products themselves became hidden from consumers, unscrupulous manufacturers would cut almost any corner to lower their costs by using various fillers and misleading consumers as to what was inside the box. In addition, the growth of food chemistry meant that many new chemicals could be added to food to enhance shelf-life and stability. This week we see, as a result of rapid technological change, the debates about the necessity (or not) of government to regulate food manufacturers to ensure purity and honesty.

### Feb 7
- Deborah Blum, _The Poison Squad_ (Chs. 2 and 4), 29--46; 65--79. These two chapters describe the kinds of adulteration that were common in the late 1800s, as well as the extent to which food adulteration was seen as a serious threat to not only food purity, but food safety. It also starts to outline (and we'll see more on Wednesday) the complex political battles that are behind the push to create the Pure Food and Drug act of 1906. The chief protagonist in these chapters is Harvey Wiley, who is not introduced in the chapters we're reading for today, but has been mentioned in several previous readings as a crusader for more federal regulation of the burgeoning food industry in the later 19th-century.

#### SKIM for flavor
We won't spend a lot of time on these, but it's important to note how concern about food adulteration had a long history even by the 1880s and 90s as we're focused on this week.
- Fredrick Accum, [A Treatise on Adulterations of Food and Culinary Poisons](https://www.google.com/books/edition/A_Treatise_on_Adulterations_of_Food_and/QMqIbr69qpQC?hl=en) (1820). Skim through the Table of Contents and read 1--15.
- Sylvester Graham, [A Defense of the Graham System of Living: Or, Remarks on Diet and Regimen. Dedicated to the Rising Generation](https://books.google.com/books?id=ODRlD83ww9IC), 7--15; 88--89; 95--104.

{% include alert.html class='info' title='IN CLASS' text="
- Reminder of your [Ad Analysis Assignment](newspaper-ads-guide).
- Heinz and purity overview/slides
- Discussion of the Blum chapters on adulterations and preservatives, and the broader question of government regulation of food manufacturers.
"%}


### Feb 9
- Deborah Blum, _The Poison Squad_ (Chs. 7 and 8), 119--152. As for Monday, these two chapters from Blum's book go by quickly. I think they do a nice job of describing the context of Sinclair writing _The Jungle_ and the political issues it sparked. As you read, be thinking about how this more elaborate description of Sinclair, Wiley, and the 1906 Pure Food and Drug Act adds a lot more depth to how it is often summarized (as we've read). That's what we'll focus on in class. There are a billion different people mentioned here and specific aren't important for us--just get a general idea of what the issues are.
- Upton Sinclair, _The Jungle_, 97--105; 140--46 (chapters 9 and 14). Even before this week, we've seen plenty of references to _The Jungle_. These few pages give you a more concrete impression of the book itself. The selections also give you a stronger flavor of how the book was primarily about the working conditions and social life of immigrants around the turn of the century, rather than food purity or safety.

## 5: Pure and Modern Milk
This week we're learning to read quickly and extract the main point from a food book. The main topic is how the production and distribution and consumption of milk changed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries as cities grew in size (both demographically and physically), pushing dairy farms farther from cities and also needing to scale up. We'll see how a lot of what we take for granted with milk---as a natural, wholesome, and safe food---has a surprisingly contested history behind it. The story behind milk perfectly illustrates the themes of the last few weeks in terms of how technology was employed to make "pure" food by improving nature.


### Feb 14
- Kendra Smith-Howard, _Pure and Modern Milk_ (Intro, Chs. 1 and 2), 3--35; 36--66.

### Feb 16
- Kendra Smith-Howard, _Pure and Modern Milk_ (Ch. 3), 67--97.

### Feb 18
NO CLASS!

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Book Review' text="
Follow the [Book Review Guide](book-review-guide)! We're not reading the whole book, so the review applies to only the chapters for this week.
"%}



## 6: Industrializing Food
Continuing with the same theme as milk, this week we look at how farms became more like factories in the early 20th century. For Monday, we look not at a specific industry as we have been, but focus on the changing nature of farming itself, and the development of the modern food system (including not just processes, but also attitudes toward it). The main point of the Johnstone reading is in contrasting urban and rural values as farm life changes dramatically with new technology and increasing urbanization. For Wednesday we look at the drive to industrialize animals to scale up production and lower costs. This week also continues our exploration of our changing relationship to nature driven (in part) by food production.

### Feb 21
- Deborah Fitzgerald, _Every Farm a Factory: The Industrial Ideal in American Agriculture_, 10--32. Available as a PDF in Zotero and [ONLINE](http://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/unm/detail.action?docID=3419843). This chapter describes diversity of farming in the U.S. before 1920 and how the logic of the urban factory came to transform the idea of farming and food production. It's a little dry, but excellent background for the Johnstone article (from 1940).
- Paul H. Johnstone, _Old Ideals Versus New Ideas in Farm Life_ (1940), 111--112; 116--119; 144--152; 157--167. (NOTE: within the pages specified, always read from one section heading to another.) This is another primary source---an article from 1940 that describes how farms and farm life were changing rapidly in the early 20th century. You'll notice a lot of overlap what Fitzgerald describes, and take special note of the tensions between urban and rural values, and changing attitudes toward ownership, business, and labor around 1920.


### Feb 23
Two options for today's discussion. Whichever you choose, I expect that your work will show up both in today's discussion AND in the essay assignment for the week, due on Friday as usual. Either read ONE of these fairly carefully and come to class ready to share what you learned---particularly the big picture takeaways. OR, skim both and be prepared to comment on key similarities and differences.

- William Boyd, "Making Meat: Science, Technology, and American Poultry Production", 631--664.
- Mark Finlay, "Hogs, antibiotics, and the industrial environments of postwar agriculture", 237--254.


### Feb 25
NO CLASS!

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='DUE: WEEK IN REVIEW' text="
For this week, write ~600--800  words on what you learned or thought was most significant about industrializing farms/meat. Post your essay to the discussion board on Learn as the last few assignments. The best essays will draw from ALL the readings for the week together (including the one you didn't read but learned about on Wednesday).
"%}



## 7: Cold War Cooking
This week brings us two somewhat paradoxical and concurrent trends: the development of refrigeration to have fresher food and frozen foods that were anything but fresh, but very convenient. You might think given the ubiquity of both of these now, that it was an inevitable development of technology. But we'll look at how contested the growth of these were and how they refigured the American kitchen.


{% include alert.html class='warning' title='Read Quickly' text="
There are three big chunks of reading for this week, but they all go fast. Challenge yourself to read quickly without skipping big chunks. We'll address the main points in class, so all you need to do is have a broad familiarity with what the readings are trying to outline. There is a lot of historical detail to support the authors' claims, which is easy to skim once you've got the main idea.

### Mar 2
I don't expect you to read 80 pages for one day of class, but we're going to talk about the whole book as preparation for your review due on Friday. At a minimum, you should be able to read the first chapter carefully and skim the second. You'll have time to review them later while you're writing your review. This is much less dense than the milk book, so it's a pretty quick read and we can cover it in a single day. And to practice reading quickly is part of reason for the exercises.

- Laura Shapiro, _Something from the Oven_, 3--40.

## 8: Sweetness and Risk
This week is about how technology in food creates new concerns and debates about risk. We've already seen in the pure food week how food could be risky from a health standpoint when left purely to capitalist markets. But this week we look at the intersection of scientific understandings of risk versus public perception of them.

## 11: Risky Ingredients
Continuing the theme of risk, this week we look at the modern state of food additives and the intersection of food safety and food technology. What would Harvey Wiley think of all this stuff in our food?

### Mar 28
- Melanie Warner, _Pandora's Lunchbox_ (Ch. 6: Better living through chemistry), 97--123 .
- Steve Ettlinger, _Twinkie, Deconstructed_ (Ch. 4: Enrichment Blend), 29--44.


### Mar 30
- Wendee Nicole, "Secret Ingredients", _Environmental Health Perspectives_ 121.6 (2013): A126--A133. This article is about food additives and the sketchy regulations (and the uses of science) that govern them and their safety.

There's a quote in the article: "_Whether a food ingredient is GRAS (Generally Recognized As Safe) depends on the general recognition of safety, not on safety per se_". What does that really mean? How is this claim supported in the article?

Questions to consider (as we did in class), but please don't try to answer all of these: What kinds of things should be allowed in our food? What is the role of regulation? How can it be enforced? How precise should labeling be? What are the problems with full transparency? How do we assess risk of food additives?
"%}



## 12: Environmental Food
It was only about 60 years ago that we really started to think about the environmental implications of the incredibly rapid rise of food technology and production. We also learn about Rachel Carson, one of the few people in history that we can point to as almost single-handedly changing the way we think about the environment and helped to create the field of ecology.

## 13: Standardizing Organic
Isn't it weird that at least culturally speaking we have two fundamental categories of food---organic and non-organic? What does that say about our food system and our expectations for food? Our discussion about organic food isn't as directly about technology as some of our other topics, but I contend that we can't talk productively about organic practices, definitions, labeling, certification, etc, unless we think about the issue in the context of the various ways in which technology and food have a very complicated relationship (that we have been trying to untangle a bit in this course).

## 14: GMOs
Perhaps no issue more than Genetically Modified Organisms embodies the various themes we've explored in the course thus far. This week we focus on the various issues of food technology that get rarified with the debate about the safety, risk, regulation, and labeling of GMO foods.
