# IN PROGRESS!
This syllabus is a living document and changes occasionally, depending on what's going on in the course. If you print it out, you'll need to keep your paper version up to date with the online version. I will always announce important changes in class.


## Required Readings
There are three required books for the course.

Besides the books, all readings that aren't already online (and some that are) will be available through the class Zotero library. This will be discussed in class, but for reference, please see the [instructions for connecting](http://fredgibbs.net/courses/etc/zotero.html). The URL for the group library is [https://www.zotero.org/groups/1647225/food-tech-society-unm/library](https://www.zotero.org/groups/1647225/food-tech-society-unm/library).



## Introductions

### Jan 21
Today we'll review the syllabus, course aims, assignments, Zotero, and general plan for the semester.

#### Background to skim
- [Feeding the World Today and Tomorrow: The Importance of Food Science and Technology](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1541-4337.2010.00127.x)


### Jan 23
**Some discussion questions for class:**  What do you think of Warner's definition of *processed food*? What are the aspirations of food scientists? How are economies of scale intimately tied to our understanding of natural food? What are key transportation developments that influenced what and how we eat? What's the difference between food grown in the ground and food produced in the lab? Does all food boil down to chemistry?

- Melanie Warner, _Pandora's Lunchbox_, xiii--xix; 1--20 (Weird Science). This is a super quick read.
