## Course Description
This course explores the relationship between food, food production, technology, and society. Taking chronological and thematic approaches simultaneously, we'll look at the impact of science and technology on food production, processing, and distribution (such as canning, refrigeration, GMOs, techno-foods). We’ll also put these developments in larger social, cultural, and demographic contexts, including industrialization, urbanization, the growing divide between food producers and consumers, the rise of global food corporations, and governmental regulation. Even more broadly, we identify connections between agriculture, ecology, consumerism, capitalism, media, politics, and the history of science and medicine.

To cover so many topics, our reading list takes a smorgasbord approach from academic and popular literature. Some of the readings go together well, others seem a bit more isolated. Some of them reinforce each other, others contradict each other. There isn't any clear narrative or story that this course tries to tell; we sample widely from the buffet and to think about food production from as many angles as possible. The hope is to provide a stronger sense of where and how food is produced and the many and mostly hidden consequences of the many complicated global systems that facilitate the incredible choice of food at our fingertips. The course does not tell you how to eat, but hopefully how you can think more critically about the implications of our food production and consumption choices.

## Student Learning Outcomes
- Articulate the history of the US food system and its relationship with technological developments
- Think broadly and critically about how food is produced and how technological improvements have altered food systems
- Articulate clear arguments about the intersection of agriculture, consumerism, environmental and population health
- Understand modern technological developments with respect to food in historical context


## Work Requirements and Grading
- Thorough preparedness and engaged participation in most every class meeting. This is a class that's focused on cultivating different perspectives about how we can think about food, technology, and society---not just memorizing and regurgitating supposedly important "facts". (16 points; roughly .5 points per class)

- Two 900-word [book reviews](book-review-guide). You will be writing reviews of required books that we read and talk about together, so it's a kind of "test" to see if you've been paying attention. (10 points each; 20 points total)

- Two 2-page [executive summaries](exec-summary-guide) of class readings (10 points each; 20 points total)

- Two readings quizzes (2 points each; 4 points total)

- One ~900-word [website analysis](website-analysis-guide) on GMO safety (10 points)

- One ~900-word [Old newspaper ad analysis](newspaper-ads-guide) (10 points)

- ~1800-word final essay (20 points):
  - Make an argument for the three most significant changes in food due to technology. You can only pick three as the MOST important, but you should mention lots of important factors that go along with those to show what you've learned in the course. We'll talk more about strategies for this option the last week of class
  - Write a review of _Tomatoland_, following the models of our previous book reviews. We will discuss the book but not to the same extent as the others. Your review however, will be more like a final than a book review in that it must show you analyzing the book in terms of the course (hence the many extra words)


### Submission Policies
- You can resubmit all assignments within one week of getting them back for re-grading. You get about the average between the two grades. This is a safety net, not something you should plan on using.

- Late work is not accepted unless due to a medical emergency. You can submit work per the resubmission policy to avoid getting a 0 for the assignment.

- Work is due in class in hard copy. Emailed assignments will be ignored. If you have an emergency or unavoidable conflict that prevents you from attending class, you can turn it in the next class that you can attend for full credit.

### Please Ask for Help
Please please please come talk me at any time. I'm alway happy to tell you how I think you're doing in the class and how it can be improved (if at all).

If life gets overwhelming during the course, it can be tempting to drift away from an elective course like this. Rather than disappear, please come talk with me about how we can accommodate your circumstances and thus avoid digging a huge hole from which it becomes increasingly difficult to escape.
