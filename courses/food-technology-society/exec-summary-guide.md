# Executive Summary Guide

## What is it?
An executive summary is a highly compressed way of communicating key ideas and offering evidence/support for them. It takes the form of a set of bullet points (and sub-bullets) rather than narrative prose, that should be take up no more than two pages.

Your summary should be about 1/2 historical summary from the sources, 1/2 analysis or connection to previous readings, including relevant history that IS NOT mentioned but was discussed in other readings. This exercise should help you keep making connections between course material that I would have tried to do in discussion, and should, hopefully, make your final much easier to write.

The bullet points should make writing more efficient because you don't have to spend time writing and revising formal prose, and it makes reading more efficient by focusing on ideas over narrative. Even limited to bullets, an effective summary still has an overall point and flow to it. In other words, just because you're using bullets DOES NOT mean you should turn in a random collection of ideas. It still requires thought and care to produce.

Check out a [sample executive summary](exec-summary-example) on the Bentley article about Gerber baby food that we skipped.


## Assignment Purpose
This assignment shows that you're doing the reading and thinking about how to relate them to each other and our discussions. Previously, you could do this in our class meetings as well. Now this exercise will be the primary medium to show that you're learning and thinking critically. And they help me give you the most appropriate grade for your effort at the end of the term.

In terms of the writing itself, the assignments encourage/force you to focus on the clarity and concision of your thinking and expression. It's a super useful skill that you'll frequently employ in your future career, whatever it is.


## What you're being graded on (the basis of the score sheet)
- How intelligently you formulate an answer to the set of questions. As always, the best summaries do not simply answer one question after the next, but present a cohesive answer relevant to the questions. It may or may not explicitly address every single question.
- How well you create and follow a logical structure and progression to your bullet points. A random collection of ideas will be frowned upon (and graded down).
- Using only bullet points (and sub-bullets) to articulate your ideas. Bullet points by definition are short and to the point; 2-3 shortish sentences MAX.
  - Don't write small paragraphs.
  - Use complete sentences. Bullet points does NOT mean sentence fragments.
- The extent you can combine concision, clarity, and thoroughness. Revisions are the only way to achieve effective bullets and an effective summary. I will be asking myself if it seems obvious that you've used the [revision guide](writing-advice).
- EFFORT! If you're asking yourself "what does Gibbs want?", the short answer is: EVIDENCE OF EFFORT. I want you to show me that you've done the reading, thought about it, thought about how it relates to the other readings, and made a serious effort to answer the questions I've posed. You'll be graded primarily on what seems to be the effort you put into the assignment, not on whether you mention X, Y, or Z. But if you don't mention what are obviously main points from the readings that everyone else is mentioning, I can only assume you didn't try very hard.

## Formatting Requirements (revised for online submissions)
These requirements are EASY, and are selfishly designed to make it easier for me to read all your essays on the screen in a short time without straining my eyes, fraying my nerves, and lowering your grade out of frustration. If you do not follow them, I will probably ask you to fix it before I grade it.

- Two page soft maximum (if a tiny bit spills onto a third page, that's fine)
- 11 pt. san-serif font (easier to read on a screen)
- 1" margins on all sides
- 1.5 line spacing


## Tips for success
 - **Be specific.** Something like, "Cans of tuna had too much mercury" tells me little more than you have a pulse. Don't waste our time, please.
 - **Provide specific citations.** This forces you to double check your own memory and interpretation of the readings, and helps you avoid making false claims. In your references to the readings, use page numbers in parentheses.
 - **Paraphase.** Avoid full quotations (short phrases are fine), since you want use all the space for your own thinking.
 - **Be selective.** You canâ€™t fit everything worth saying into your essay. Choose carefully what you think is most important! You're being graded on your ability to separate the wheat from the chaff.
 - **Revise, revise, revise.** Once you have a complete draft of everything you want to say, you are about 50% done. Set it aside (and budget time for this!), then come back and economize your prose. Remove simple sentences that force you to be unnecessarily verbose. See the [revision guide](writing-advice). **Revisions are hard!** But they are the only way to make your writing---and your THINKING---shine.


## Questions
It is always worthwhile to talk about these things in class; don't hesitate to ask. Email is OK, too, especially for quick questions.
