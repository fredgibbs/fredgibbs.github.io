# Executive Summary Sample
For details for the executive summary assignment, see the [summary guide](exec-summary-guide).

Here's a sample prompt:
### Explain how the rise of baby food and Gerber in particular represents early 20th century relationship between food and technology.

1/2 historical summary from the sources, 1/2 analysis or connection to previous readings, including relevant history that IS NOT mentioned but was discussed in other readings. This exercise should help you keep making connections between course material that I would have tried to do in discussion, and should, hopefully, make your final much easier to write.


## Baby Food and Technological Progress

- From roughly 1850 to 1950, infant feeding changed dramatically as science, doctors, and motherhood were transformed by an industrializing and modernizing society.
  - In the preindustrial western world, 95% of children were breast-fed, usually for a year (94).
  - Only light, simple, thin gruel mixtures were given to children before 12 months of age (95).
  - By 1950s, average age doctors recommended solid food was 4-6 weeks.

- As early as late 1880s, forerunners of infant formulas appeared on the market (98).

- Around 1900, we start to see a "medicalization of motherhood", meaning that scientists, doctors, and nutritionists argued that they knew better than mothers what's best for babies (97).
  - Formula feeding was easier to measure and regulate.
  - Medicalization stoked fears among mothers that their milk was inadequate.

- By 1920s, home economists and dietitians were introducing Americans to vitamins and their importance in diet (100).
  - Fruits and vegetables became a more essential part of a baby's diet.
  - Although Gerber used its product's high vitamin content as a selling point, it wasn't any higher than regular canned vegetables.

- As canning industry grew and canned good were increasingly accepted by consumers throughout the early 1900s, there emerged a market opportunity to mash up vegetables already being canned and market them as baby food.
  - The success of baby food encouraged the Fremont Canning Co. to focus solely on baby food to change its name to Gerber Products Co.
  - Production rose quickly in terms of number of cans produced. 1930: 842K; 1931: 1.31M; 1932: 2.26M.

- During 1930s, baby food marketing emphasized purity and wholesomeness, convenience, economy, and modernity (105).
  - As with many other new products coming on the market, convenience featured prominently in advertising.
  - Advertisements even argued that mothers were doing their baby's a disservice by spending too much time preparing food when they should be paying attention to their child (107).

  - The creation and marketing of Gerber baby food helped drive down the age when babies would starting eating solid food.
    - Baby food thus became both a supplement and a substitute for breast milk.

- The story of baby food obviously depended on the growing success of the canning industry, although not much about canning in general was mentioned in the Bentley article, particular how the industry built consumer trust through science.
  - Similarly, there was very little attention to consumers' response to seeing more baby food on shelves. Did they trust it?

- The emphasis on purity in baby food advertising parallels how health reformers of the early 1900s called for purifying milk and improving nature through technology.
  - Milk made "pure" and "wholesome" through techniques like pasteurization and homogenization were advertised as superior to the raw product.

- The emphasis on convenience and modernity of baby food echoes the kind of advertising used to sell refrigerators.
