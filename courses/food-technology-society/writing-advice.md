# Writing Advice


## Easy ways to dramatically improve your writing


### Learn to use apostrophe's
Its not hard to get them right and they show how careful your being. Even in the 2020’s, computers will not fix these errors for you. Besides, careful editing is it’s own reward.

### Avoid run-on sentences, they are very confusing
Commas and periods are not interchangeable, usually a slight rewording greatly improves clarity like “Avoid run-on sentences because they are very confusing."

### Think twice about starting sentences with “this” or “that”
This often makes it harder to follow your idea. This is often the result of stringing ideas together in a logical way as you’re drafting prose, but often you end up not talking about the same thing by the end. This also means it’s easy for the reader to lose track of what “this” really stands for.

That is usually easy to fix by replacing a leading “this” with a more concrete subject: Sentences that start with “this” or “that” make writing hard to follow because they get too abstract really quickly; use a concrete subject instead.

### ADJECTIVES AND ADVERBS ARE YOUR FRIEND
They help your writing flow and save you words.

CLUNKY: The dog was blue, and was ashamed of its color, so it kept running through the car wash.
SMOOTHER: The blue dog, ashamed of its color, repeatedly ran through the car wash.

Note the clunky way is how we think and get ideas into words. The smoother way is what we get from revising and polishing rough written drafts of our ideas.

### Use passive constructions sparingly
Look for unnecessary is, was, be, or being verbs. See if you can be clearer by using a concrete subject.

Passive: It was not clear how the assignment would be graded.
Active: The assignment instructions did not clearly explain how grading would work.
Better: The hastily written assignment instructions provided only an unhelpfully ambiguous grading policy.

Passive: The king was getting impatient.
Active: The king grew impatient.

Passive: This class is boring.
Active: This class bores me.

In the last example, you might deliberately choose the passive construction if your point were that any objective observer would also declare that the class’s very existence should be characterized as boring. If you want to emphasize the agency of the class to bore students, particularly you, but it’s at least conceivable that other students might not find it boring, the active construction would be more precise.

Another way of thinking about it is that the passive voice describes a state of being (how the class _is_), which is pretty generic and vague. But sometimes that's what you want. The active voice emphasizes an action (what the class _does_).

All I’m saying is that you should choose deliberately.
