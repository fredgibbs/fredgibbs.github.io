- Fred Gibbs \([fwgibbs@unm.edu](mailto:fwgibbs@unm.edu)\)

## Credit Hour Statement
This is a three credit-hour course. Class meets for three 50-minute sessions of direct instruction for fifteen weeks during the Fall 2024 semester. Please plan for a minimum of six hours of out-of-class work (or homework, study, assignment completion, and class preparation) each week.

## Course Description
How can digital technology facilitate critical engagement with cultural heritage and its significance? How are cultural institutions are engaging with technology and what does the future look like? How can the digitization of historical artifacts--from pottery and jewelry to entire historic sites--change the ways we can understand past cultures? How can citizen science models energize the humanities? How is AI going to shape our access to and stories about the past? This is a class that's focused on discussing and making things, not just memorizing and regurgitating a historical facts. 

We'll examine how digital storytelling, virtual exhibits, digital historical tours, photogrammetry (3D modeling) of historic artifacts and sites, interface design for cultural collections, and digital mapping can help bring history and its relevance to life. We’ll draw from a wide range of fields including digital public history, historic preservation, museum studies, digital archiving, spatial humanities, and media studies. We'll collaborate on some posters, maps, 3D prints, digital essays, and a fictional interview with a campus building. Although we talk a lot about technology and this is a hands-on course (a laptop is helpful but not required), no technical skills are expected or needed--just an open mind about exploring the future of digital heritage!

 
## Student Learning Outcomes
- Think critically about how technology shapes our access to and interpretations of the past
- Examine the impact of the digitization of cultural heritage and how digital archives reshape our access to the past
- Begin to experiment with new tools, workflows, methods, and techniques for large-scale research questions in history
- Identify cultural and algorithmic biases in searching for historical information
- Critique how digital publishing challenges historical authority and expertise

### Please Ask for Help
I heartily encouraged you to speak with me at any time about how I think you're doing in the class and how it can be improved (if at all). If life gets overwhelming during the course, it can be tempting to drift away from an elective course like this. Rather than disappear, please come talk with me about how we can accommodate your circumstances and thus avoid digging a huge hole from which it becomes increasingly difficult to escape.

### Absences Policy
Up to three unexcused absences are allowed without any grade penalty. However, after that, you lose roughly two points for every absence---so that basically every two missed classes lowers your grade one notch (B+ to B, for instance). Family or medical emergencies and needed wellness days are excused absences. I don't need any details, but you should get in touch with me ASAP about them so we can be sure you can resume the course seamlessly when the time is right.

## Accommodations
UNM is committed to providing equitable access to learning opportunities for students with documented disabilities. As your instructor, it is my objective to facilitate an inclusive classroom setting, in which students have full access and opportunity to participate. To engage in a confidential conversation about the process for requesting reasonable accommodations for this class and/or program, please contact Accessibility Resource Center (https://arc.unm.edu/) at arcsrvs@unm.edu or by phone at 505-277-3506.

## Title IX
Our classroom and university should always be spaces of mutual respect, kindness, and support, without fear of discrimination, harassment, or violence. If you ever need assistance or have concerns about incidents that violate this principle, please access campus support resources. These include confidential services at LoboRESPECT Advocacy Center, the Women’s Resource Center, and the LGBTQ Resource Center. The University of New Mexico prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex (including gender, sex stereotyping, gender expression, and gender identity). UNM faculty and graduate teaching assistants are considered “responsible employees.” “Responsible employees” must communicate reports of sexual harassment, sexual misconduct and sexual violence to Compliance, Ethics and Equal Opportunity. For more information on the campus policy regarding sexual misconduct, reporting, and reporting for “responsible employees,” please see UAP 2720 and UAP 2740.


## Respectful Conduct
I am committed to building with you a positive classroom environment in which everyone can learn. I reserve the right to intervene and enforce standards of respectful behavior when classroom conduct is inconsistent with University expectations [and/or classroom community agreements]. Interventions and enforcement may include but are not limited to required meetings to discuss classroom expectations, written notification of expectations, and/or removal from a class meeting. Removal from a class meeting will result in an unexcused absence. [Insert number] or more unexcused absences may result in permanent removal and a drop from the course (see attendance policy). The University of New Mexico ensures freedom of academic inquiry, free expression and open debate, and a respectful campus through adherence to the following policies: D75: Classroom Conduct, Student Code of Conduct, University Policy 2240 – Respectful Campus, University Policy 2210 – Campus Violence. 


## Responsible Learning and Academic Honesty
Cheating and plagiarism (academic dishonesty) are often driven by lack of time, desperation, or lack of knowledge about how to identify a source. Communicate with me and ask for help, even at the last minute, rather than risking your academic career by committing academic dishonesty. Academic dishonesty involves claiming that work created by another source is your own original work. It is a Student Code of Conduct violation that can lead to a disciplinary procedure. When you use a resource in work submitted for this class, document how you used it and distinguish clearly between your original work and the material taken from the resource. 

## AI Tools and Academic Integrity Statement
In this course, we recognize that artificial intelligence (AI) tools, such as ChatGPT, Grammarly, or other generative technologies, can be useful for brainstorming ideas, clarifying concepts, or refining your writing. However, the use of these tools must align with the principles of academic integrity and the goals of historical scholarship. To ensure proper use of AI tools, please follow these guidelines:

### Permitted Uses:
- Generating preliminary ideas or discussion points related to historical topics.
- Clarifying grammar, structure, or style in your writing.
- Exploring alternative ways of expressing or presenting your original ideas.

### Prohibited Uses:
- Submitting AI-generated text as your own work without modification or acknowledgment.
- Using AI tools to fabricate evidence, citations, or historical interpretations.
- Relying solely on AI tools for analysis or argumentation, as this diminishes the development of critical thinking skills central to the study of history.

### Acknowledging AI Assistance
If you use AI to assist with your work (e.g., generating outlines or improving phrasing), include a brief note in your assignment (e.g., “I used ChatGPT to brainstorm ideas for this response” or “I used Grammarly to refine the grammar in my paper”).
Proper acknowledgment ensures transparency and models ethical engagement with new technologies.

### Developing Historical Thinking Skills
The core of this course is developing your ability to think critically, evaluate evidence, and construct arguments. While AI tools can support your learning, they should complement, not replace, your efforts in engaging deeply with the material. If you are unsure whether your use of AI aligns with these guidelines, please reach out to me for clarification. Misuse of AI tools may be treated as a violation of academic integrity policies. Our goal is to help you use these technologies ethically and effectively while building your historical knowledge and skills.



## Citizenship and/or Immigration Status
All students are welcome in this class regardless of citizenship, residency, or immigration status.  I will respect your privacy if you choose to disclose your status. As for all students in the class, family emergency-related absences are normally excused with reasonable notice to the professor, as noted in the attendance guidelines above.  UNM as an institution has made a core commitment to the success of all our students, including members of our undocumented community.  The Administration’s welcome is found on our website: http://undocumented.unm.edu/.


## Land Acknowledgement
Founded in 1889, the University of New Mexico sits on the traditional homelands of the Pueblo of Sandia. The original peoples of New Mexico Pueblo, Navajo, and Apache since time immemorial, have deep connections to the land and have made significant contributions to the broader community statewide. We honor the land itself and those who remain stewards of this land throughout the generations and also acknowledge our committed relationship to Indigenous peoples. We gratefully recognize our history.
