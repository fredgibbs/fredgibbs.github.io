# Artificial History

## Logistics
- Class: T,Th 2:00 - 4:30 (usually ~4:00)
- Office Hours: W 9:30-11 @ 1077 Mesa Vista Hall
- Fred Gibbs \([fwgibbs@unm.edu](mailto:fwgibbs@unm.edu)\)

## Credit Hour Statement
This is a three credit-hour course. Class meets for two ~120-minute sessions of direct instruction for EIGHT weeks during the Spring 2025 semester. Please plan for a minimum of six hours of out-of-class work (or homework, study, assignment completion, and class preparation) each week.

## Course Description
How can digital technology facilitate critical engagement with cultural heritage and its significance? How can the digitization of historical artifacts--from pottery and jewelry to entire historic sites--change the ways we can understand past cultures? How can citizen science models energize the humanities? How is AI going to shape our access to and stories about the past? 

We'll examine how digital storytelling, virtual exhibits, photogrammetry (3D modeling) of historic artifacts, and new interfaces for cultural collections, can help bring history and its relevance to life. No technical skills are expected or needed--just an open mind about exploring the future of digital heritage!

 
## Course Goals
- Examine the role of the past in an "always new" digital world
- Think critically about how technology shapes our access to and interpretations of the past
- Identify cultural and algorithmic biases in "objective" data
- Consider the role of humanities, particularly empathy, creativity, and authenticity, and the future of AI-work
- Cultivate imagination and resilience in bridging humanities and technology


## Readings
There are NO REQUIRED BOOKS for this course. But you will need to subscribe to the course Zotero library to access assigned articles. This will be discussed in class, but for reference, please see the [instructions for connecting](http://fredgibbs.net/courses/etc/zotero.html). The URL for the group library is [https://www.zotero.org/groups/1647219/digital-history-unm/items](https://www.zotero.org/groups/1647219/digital-history-unm/items).


## Required Work
- Preparedness and engagement in most class meetings (40%)
- Humanities Poster Assignment (10%)
- Campus History Essay and Interview (20%)
- Artifact virtual model and description (15%)
- Final Reflection (15%)


### Final Grades
All work is graded on a 4.0 grading scale (roughly 4 = A, 3 = B, etc.), and weighted by the percents indicated above.
So, if you get, in order above, scores of 4,3,3,3, your grade is:
4(.6) + 3(.1) + 3(.15) + 3(.15) = 3.6 = B+ (maybe A-)


Letter&nbsp;&nbsp; | Percent&nbsp;&nbsp;	| 4.0 Scale
A+ |	97-100|	4.3
A	|93-96|	4.0
A-	|90-92	|3.7
B+|	87-89|3.3
B	|83-86|	3.0
B-|	80-82	|2.7
C+|77-79	|2.3
C|73-76	|2.0
C-	|70-72	|1.7
D+|	67-69	|1.3
D|	65-66|	1.0
F	| < 65	|0.0


### Graduate Work
Graduate students will prepare an NEH Digital Humanities grant proposal on any topic or technology. Hopefully it will be at least potentially useful for your own, but feel free to dream up something totally different that sounds fun. The requirement for the proposal (in real life, too, not just the course) is that marries the humanities and technology in some way. The grading scale is same as above, but participation is 20% and the grant proposal is 20%.


### Please Ask for Help
I heartily encouraged you to speak with me at any time about how I think you're doing in the class. If life gets overwhelming during the course, it can be tempting to drift away from an elective course like this. Rather than disappear, please come talk with me about how we can accommodate your circumstances and get back on track.

### Absences Policy
Because your grade depends on class participation, there isn't a separate absence policy. If you miss more than a couple classes, your grade will go down because you aren't there to engage. Urgent family / home / medical situations are entirely excused and won't count against you. If you are facing a longer-term situation, I don't need any details, but you should get in touch with me ASAP about it so we can make a plan to finish the course in a timely way (potentially with an incomplete).

### If you need a computer
A computer is not required for this course, but will make life easier. You can [check one out if available](https://it.unm.edu/get-a-computer/computers.html).


## Accommodations
UNM is committed to providing equitable access to learning opportunities for students with documented disabilities. As your instructor, it is my objective to facilitate an inclusive classroom setting, in which students have full access and opportunity to participate. To engage in a confidential conversation about the process for requesting reasonable accommodations for this class and/or program, please contact Accessibility Resource Center (https://arc.unm.edu/) at arcsrvs@unm.edu or by phone at 505-277-3506.

## Title IX
Our classroom and university should always be spaces of mutual respect, kindness, and support, without fear of discrimination, harassment, or violence. If you ever need assistance or have concerns about incidents that violate this principle, please access campus support resources. These include confidential services at LoboRESPECT Advocacy Center, the Women’s Resource Center, and the LGBTQ Resource Center. The University of New Mexico prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex (including gender, sex stereotyping, gender expression, and gender identity). UNM faculty and graduate teaching assistants are considered “responsible employees.” “Responsible employees” must communicate reports of sexual harassment, sexual misconduct and sexual violence to Compliance, Ethics and Equal Opportunity. For more information on the campus policy regarding sexual misconduct, reporting, and reporting for “responsible employees,” please see UAP 2720 and UAP 2740.


## Respectful Conduct
I am committed to building with you a positive classroom environment in which everyone can learn. I reserve the right to intervene and enforce standards of respectful behavior when classroom conduct is inconsistent with University expectations [and/or classroom community agreements]. Interventions and enforcement may include but are not limited to required meetings to discuss classroom expectations, written notification of expectations, and/or removal from a class meeting. Removal from a class meeting will result in an unexcused absence. [Insert number] or more unexcused absences may result in permanent removal and a drop from the course (see attendance policy). The University of New Mexico ensures freedom of academic inquiry, free expression and open debate, and a respectful campus through adherence to the following policies: D75: Classroom Conduct, Student Code of Conduct, University Policy 2240 – Respectful Campus, University Policy 2210 – Campus Violence. 


## Responsible Learning and Academic Honesty
Cheating and plagiarism (academic dishonesty) are often driven by lack of time, desperation, or lack of knowledge about how to identify a source. Communicate with me and ask for help, even at the last minute, rather than risking your academic career by committing academic dishonesty. Academic dishonesty involves claiming that work created by another source is your own original work. It is a Student Code of Conduct violation that can lead to a disciplinary procedure. When you use a resource in work submitted for this class, document how you used it and distinguish clearly between your original work and the material taken from the resource. 

## AI Tools 
In this course, artificial intelligence (AI) tools, such as ChatGPT, Grammarly, or other generative technologies, can be useful for brainstorming ideas, clarifying concepts, or refining your writing. However, the use of these tools must align with the principles of academic integrity. To ensure proper use of AI tools, please follow these guidelines:

### Permitted Uses:
- Generating preliminary ideas or discussion points related to historical topics.
- Getting ideas for sources to investigate further.
- Clarifying grammar, structure, or style in your writing.
- Exploring alternative ways of expressing or presenting your original ideas.

### Prohibited Uses:
- Submitting AI-generated text as your own work without modification or acknowledgment. It's not plagiarism exactly, but it's the same KIND of thing and clearly violates UNM's Academic Integrity policy.
- Using AI tools to fabricate evidence, citations, or historical interpretations UNLESS IT'S PART OF THE ASSIGNMENT.
- Relying solely on AI tools for analysis or argumentation, as this diminishes the development of critical thinking skills central to studying the humanities.

### Acknowledge AI assistance
If you use AI to assist with your work (e.g., generating outlines or improving phrasing), include a brief note in your assignment (e.g., “I used ChatGPT to brainstorm ideas” or “I used Grammarly to help revise some clunky sentences”). 

### Use as a tool, not a substitute for thought
While AI tools can support your learning, they should complement, not replace, your effort to engage with the material. If you are unsure whether your use of AI aligns with these guidelines, please reach out to me for clarification. Misuse of AI tools may be treated as a violation of academic integrity policies. My goal is to help you use these technologies ethically and effectively while building your critical thinking skills.

NOTE: ChatGPT was used to help generate this AI use policy.

## Citizenship and/or Immigration Status
All students are welcome in this class regardless of citizenship, residency, or immigration status.  I will respect your privacy if you choose to disclose your status. As for all students in the class, family emergency-related absences are normally excused with reasonable notice to the professor, as noted in the attendance guidelines above.  UNM as an institution has made a core commitment to the success of all our students, including members of our undocumented community.  The Administration’s welcome is found on our website: http://undocumented.unm.edu/.


## Land Acknowledgement
Founded in 1889, the University of New Mexico sits on the traditional homelands of the Pueblo of Sandia. The original peoples of New Mexico Pueblo, Navajo, and Apache since time immemorial, have deep connections to the land and have made significant contributions to the broader community statewide. We honor the land itself and those who remain stewards of this land throughout the generations and also acknowledge our committed relationship to Indigenous peoples. We gratefully recognize our history.
