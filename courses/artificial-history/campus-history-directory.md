## Updating directory data
We need to make sure your new essay is visible on the directory page. That page is generated through our [shared Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AE1X-dDphqyYjVlUj1w0xvWivnu0e7EtyxzuGNjbock/edit?usp=sharing)

Update the columns for your new page according to the directions below:

### place-name
You should already have added your essay title in the first column (which you can change any time)

### popup-teaser
This is used on the map page to show where a building is. This column is 1 sentence "teaser" to get people to click on your building. If you don't have a building to outline, skip this.

### card-description
This is the 2 sentence description that displays on each of the cards for our essays. For inspiration, mimic some of the other card descriptions. You can tell which are more intriguing than others.

### folder-name
This is super important because it makes the image and the link to your essay work. Make sure this **EXACTLY** matches your folder name in GitHub that you created under the `essays` folder. Remember that **your folder name should be all lower case, with hyphens instead of spaces**.

{% include alert.html class='warning' 
title = 'Make sure everything matches' 
text = " 
If there is ANY difference between your GitHub folder name and what appears in this column, the link to your page will not work, and the image will never show up. BE CAREFUL!
"
%}

### image-filename
This should match the name of some image in your `images` folder. Again, it has to match **EXACTLY**
- This includes all capitalization. `.jpg` and `.JPG` are DIFFERENT! 
- Make sure you are using the corrent file extension. Some of your files might be `.jpg`, others `.PNG`, or whatever.

### type
Do you best to pick one of the existing building types for yours. Let me know if nothing really fits and we'll figure what new type to use.

### start and end columns
If you know these, or at least the year, add them here. These are really being used at the moment, so they don't affect anything.
