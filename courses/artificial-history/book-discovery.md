## What to do
- Search for a history-related book at https://unm.worldcat.org/ or https://library.unm.edu/. The topic really doesn't matter, BUT MAKE SURE that you find a book that is physically (not just digitially) available at UNM.
- Note what you see as "relevant" items in the first few pages of search results for that book.
- Note the library call number for the book, and go find it in the stacks.
- Browse around the book and note what kind of books are physically around it---look at a few shelves above and below, too, not just the few books on either side of your target book.


## Critical Reflection
- Why are there such differences between what was digitally related and what was physically nearby to your book?
- What can we extrapolate from this exercise to the real world?
