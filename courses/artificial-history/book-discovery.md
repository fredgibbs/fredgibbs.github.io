## What to do
- Search for a history-related book (but something else if you really want to) at https://unm.worldcat.org/ or https://library.unm.edu/. The topic really doesn't matter, BUT MAKE SURE that you find a book that is PHYSICALLY AVAILABLE (not just digitially) at UNM.
- Highlight / copy the title of the book and search for it
- Note what you see as "relevant" items in the first few pages of search results for that book, and how you would classify these.
- Note the library call number for the book, and go find it in the stacks.
- Browse around the book and note what kind of books are physically around it---look at a few shelves above and below, too, not just the few books on either side of your target book.


## Critical Reflection
- What kinds of differences did you find between what was digitally related and what was physically nearby to your book?
- How is this related to constructing historical narratives?
- What can we extrapolate from this exercise to the real world?
- What does this tell us about discovery algorithms?

## Participation matter
- Don't be a tree falling silently in the forest! 
- Be ready to describe your discovery "experience" in class.
