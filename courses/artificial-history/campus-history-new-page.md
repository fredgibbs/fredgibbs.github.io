## _{{page.site-name}}_ Revision Guide

This guide is useful ONLY AFTER you have followed the directions for [setting up your repository](campus-history-setup).

Once you have your own copy of the  _{{page.site-name}}_ repository AND your own version of the website is running (the URL will look like https://USERNAME.github.io/{{page.repository-name}}/), you are ready to proceed.

### Save time with bookmarks
Create bookmarks for two locations you will be visiting often:
- YOUR own _{{page.site-name}}_ **REPOSITORY**: https://github.com/USERNAME/{{page.repository-name}}/
  - Replace USERNAME with your GitHub username!
- YOUR own _{{page.site-name}}_ **WEBSITE**: https://USERNAME.github.io/{{page.repository-name}}

## Create a new page
Go to YOUR repository (the URL will look like https://github.com/USERNAME/{{page.repository-name}}/). You should see the list of files in the repository (starting with folders like _includes and _layouts).

- Click the `essays` folder 
- Click the `Add file` button in the upper right
- Type in a folder name for your essay, all lower case and with dashes (example: mesa-vista-hall), and continue typing `/index.md`
- Click the green `Commit changes...` button. Yes, you're saving an empty file.
- Be sure you're still in the `essays` folder.
- Click on the `mesa-vista-hall` folder
- Click on the `index.md` file 
- Near the upper right of the screen, click the copy icon (two overlapping rectangles)
- Click on your new page (index.md) in the folder you created, and paste the text you just copied.
 - Click the green `Commit changes...` button.


## Test your page
- Chill for a minute. Remember there is a lag between when you save your file and the website getting updated.
- Test your page by going to https://USERNAME.github.io/{{page.repository-name}} (you bookmarked it, right?) and add  `essays/your-new-folder/` to the URL to see your new page. Obviously replace your-new-folder with what you typed in the previous step.

## Edit offline
Now you are ready to go in full-on edit mode for your essay. Although fine for testing, **please do not edit this long essay in the tiny GitHub text editor**. It makes it WAY TOO EASY to make mistakes that take a LOT OF TIME to fix. My favorite editor is [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/)

You should copy and paste the whole essay to somewhere else, do all your editing (possibly over a period of time, saving a local copy as you go), then copy and paste your changes to GitHub. **Make sure you save your file with the EXACT same name as the original.** You are welcome to commit your changes in smaller batches, as well, such as one paragraph at a time.

## Page build errors
If you commit a file with a syntax error (a missing quote or something like that), you will get an email saying there is a "page build error". Until you fix it, you won't see any subsequent changes you commit to your repository.
