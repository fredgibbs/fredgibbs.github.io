- Be sure all your data on the [our spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AE1X-dDphqyYjVlUj1w0xvWivnu0e7EtyxzuGNjbock/edit#gid=0) is finalized.

## Pull Requests
When you are *completely* done editing, you need to get your local changes (in YOUR repository) to the remote repository, which is the live _{{page.site-name}}_ site that everyone sees. A **pull request** in this context is like asking me, as owner of the _{{page.site-name}}_ repository you forked, to "pull" into the main repository the changes you made in your (local) repository. If I like your changes, I will "accept" the request and if I don't I will "reject" them. But this process prevents mistakes and bugs.


### How to create a pull request
- Go to the homepage of YOUR _{{page.site-name}}_ repository, and click the `Pull Request` nav link near the top.
- Click the Green `New Pull Request` button.
- GitHub will show you what changes you are making, line by line (a whole paragraph counts as a line). Verify that the changes are correct.
- Click the Green `Create Pull Request` button.
- You should see near the top a green message that says `Able to merge.` If you don't see that, you should just stop and let me know in class.
- Otherwise, click the Green `Create Pull Request` button.


## You're done!
After you make the pull request, there's nothing else to do! If you notice that you missed a typo or something you can always make another change and another pull request. Thank you for all of your hard work!
