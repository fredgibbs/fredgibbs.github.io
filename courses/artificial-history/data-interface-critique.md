# Data Interface Critique


## Goals of critiques
- Provide some summary of the main features / functionality
- Note stated or apparent intended audience
- Make it clear what the goals of the project are
- Evaluate how well the various facets of the website (design, organization, writing style, interface, functionality) facilitate its intended goals for its audience
- Note aspects that work well
- Note aspects that need improvement (and why!)
- Remember to incorporate our readings from earlier in the semester (_yes in fact there was a reason we read all those!_)
- Contemplate about how maps, databases, interfaces, and visualizations shape the kinds of (historical) interpretations the website is meant to facilitate.

## What's behind the curtain?
- What are the original sources? How accessible does the site make them?
- How easy is it to see where the data comes from and gets represented?
- Do you get a sense what data exists and what doesn't?
- How might the interface/visualization be misleading?
- How is the design working for or against the purposes of the site?
