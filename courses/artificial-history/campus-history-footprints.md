# Spatial Footprints 
MAPS ARE COOL! So we should have a map interface. For that, we need a way of creating a clickable space on a web map.

- Go to [Google Maps](http://maps.google.com).
- Click the 3-line menu icon in the upper left of the search bar.
- Click on "Your Places".
- Click on "Maps".
- Click "Create Map" at the bottom of the window pane.
- Search for your building name or otherwise make sure the space you are researching is in your browser window. Close the pop-up if you get one.
- You can see the map layer you are creating is titled "Untitled Layer". That's not helpful. **Change that to the name of your building/space, and make sure it matches your essay EXACTLY**, like `mesa-vista-hall`.
- Edit your map title to be the name of your building. You can use spaces if you want! This is helpful for later retrieval and editing, but isn't tied to anything like the layer title.
- Click the little arrow to the left of "Base Map" at the bottom.
- Choose the Satellite view and see if that's easier than the map view for your building.
- Find a zoom level that allows you to see your place all at once, but as zoomed in as possible.
- Click the "Draw a Line" icon under the search bar (it looks like a broken triangle).
- Click "Add line or shape"
- Trace out your place that you want to appear on our map. You are making a polygon, so make sure that your starting and ending points are the same, otherwise you'll make a line and that's not what we want.
- If you need to adjust a point, click the hand icon and drag whatever point you want to move.
- Click the 3-dot menu icon next to your MAP TITLE.
- Click "Export to KML/KMZ".
- Choose to EXPORT YOUR LAYER, not the map.
- VERY IMPORTANT: Check the "Export to KML..." box (the bottom of the two).
- Upload the KML file (from your Downloads directory or wherever it ended up) to your assets/kml folder. 
- Wait a few minutes, and see if your polygon shows up on your map page of the clone of campus history. If not, double check your file made it into the `kml` folder and that the filename (minus the .kml extension) matches your essay EXACTLY.
