## Course Description
What does it mean to “make history”? On one hand, to do something worth recording. On the other, to interpret and write about the past. But history is never an entirely objective and accurate reflection of the past. This course explores important questions about the production of history: What is history? What is it for? Who is it for? How have historical interpretations changed over time? What's at stake with changing narratives?

This entirely online and asynchronous course consists of short lectures, reading assignments, quizzes, and short essays that helps students learn robust research skills, particularly how to identify relevant evidence, situate it in historical context, and use it to make a convincing argument.

The core philosophy underlying the course is that historical perspective is essential for the educated citizen. We consider the difference between history and memory, how history has been used in the past to manipulate public memory, and how the study of history has been at the center of recent culture wars.


## Student Learning Outcomes (SLOs)
Through readings, lectures, discussions, examinations, and writing assignments, students will be able to:

*  EXPLAIN how humans in the past shaped their own unique historical moments, constructed historical memories, and were shaped by those moments and memories over time.
* SUMMARIZE and APPRAISE the diversity of historical experiences, interpretations, evidence in order to RECONSTRUCT past events and EVALUATE how history and historical memory can be used and misused for various purposes.
* IDENTIFY historical arguments in a variety of sources and EXPLAIN how they were constructed, EVALUATING credibility, perspective, and relevance.
* CREATE well-supported historical arguments and narratives that demonstrate their ability to read critically, think logically, and express themselves clearly in writing appropriate for their audience.
* DISTINGUISH between primary and secondary sources, IDENTIFY and EVALUATE evidence and UNDERSTAND people in their historical context.


## General Workload
Most weeks you will read two short book chapters (occasionally articles) and short excerpts from historical sources, the standard amount for a lower-division history course. Almost all weeks will have a 5-10 minute introductory video that will help provide some background and highlight important themes to look for in the readings. Most lectures and readings will have either a short reading reflection or quiz associated with them to make sure you are motivated to keep up with the lectures and reading, and to hold you accountable. Quizzes will employ a variety of kinds of questions, including short answer prompts that test your ability to synthesize information from the lecture and chapter(s).

The quizzes (about 25% of your grade for the course) are mostly straightforward, but not trivial. The goal is to make you THINK CAREFULLY and CRITICALLY about course material. You will disagree with me on some questions, which is what I want. Because this class is about interpretation and argument, you are welcome and encouraged to debate ANY quiz question that was marked as wrong on the discussion board. If you make a good argument, you'll get points for it and make up any "missed" points from the quiz.

In short, it's very easy to get whatever grade you want in the class by just keeping up with the basic work. There is no huge midterm or final that is a large percent of your grade.


## You are welcome here
I want to be VERY CLEAR: even if you have never been challenged to think about how history is made, YOU ARE WELCOME HERE! This course assumes no prior knowledge or skills. I grade quite leniently at the beginning of class and the bar slowly rises throughout the class as we dive deeper into course material and you get more comfortable with the quizzes and reading responses.

I will do everything I can do help you learn as much as you're motivated to learn, and to help you get whatever grade you're aiming for. If you feel the course structure or assignments isn't facilitating success or does not represent the effort you're putting in the course, let's talk (virtually, of course)!

### Please Ask for Help
I heartily encouraged you to speak with me at any time about how I think you're doing in the class and how you can improve your performance (if at all). If life gets overwhelming during the course (as it easily can these days), it can be tempting to drift away from a survey course like this. Rather than disappear, let's work something out to accommodate your circumstances and thus avoid digging a huge hole from which it becomes increasingly difficult to escape.
