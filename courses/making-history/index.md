## Course Description
This course is designed to introduce students to the discipline of history. It will help students understand historical thinking which include chronological thinking, historical comprehension, historical analysis and interpretation, historical research capabilities, and historical issues analysis and decision-making.

The core philosophy underlying the course is that the study of history is essential for the educated citizen. Students will consider the difference between history and memory, how history has been used in the past to manipulate public memory, and how the study of history has been at the center of recent culture wars. Through readings and class discussion students will explore the nature of the study of history and consider the place of history in their everyday lives.


## Student Learning Outcomes (SLOs)
Through readings, lectures, discussions, examinations, as well as writing assignments, students, upon completion of this course, will be able to:

* Students will be able to EXPLAIN in their work how humans in the past shaped their own unique historical moments, constructed historical memories, and were shaped by those moments and memories over time.
* Students will DISTINGUISH between primary and secondary sources, IDENTIFY and EVALUATE evidence and UNDERSTAND people in their historical context.
* Students will SUMMARIZE and APPRAISE the diversity of historical experiences, interpretations, evidence in order to RECONSTRUCT past events and EVALUATE how history and historical memory can be used and misused for various purposes.
* Students will IDENTIFY historical arguments in a variety of sources and EXPLAIN how they were constructed, EVALUATING credibility, perspective, and relevance.
* Students will CREATE well-supported historical arguments and narratives that demonstrate their ability to read critically, think logically, and express themselves clearly in writing appropriate for their audience.




## Work Requirements and Grading
Although I do not calculate grades strictly mathematically, I have provided percentages to indicate how much relative weight each component of the course receives in my evaluation of student performance.

- **Active and thoughtful participation in class discussions** (33%)

  - Because most of your participation in this course is not assigned a specific letter grade (and because many intangible factors go into a grade), what follows is my functional approach to evaluating your participation in this course. Basically, everyone starts with a B, and you gradually move it up or down depending on the consistency and quality of your class participation. If you are contributing to discussion, but unevenly, your grade moves to a B+. If you are also asking good questions (I'll let you know if you are) and highlighting important points from the readings on a regular basis, your grade moves to A-. If you are also actively engaging in the conversation each day and your comments are clearly based on the readings (not just your opinion at the time), your grade moves to an A. Conversely, you can also move your grade down by hardly ever participating in class, or making consistently superficial comments. Not showing up lowers your grade very quickly. I assign a final participation grade at the end of the course, not for each class meeting.

- **Preparation work for each class** (33%)

  - We'll divide the class into 4 groups, as equally as possible. Each group will be responsible for one of the following roles; everyone's role will change each class (by adding 1 to your role number--that is, Commenters for Monday will be Discussion Guides on Wednesday, and so on). **All posts are due by 9am the day of class.**

    1. **Commenters:** The commenters will post a 400-word critical comment on the readings. These should be high quality but informal writing, like you were writing for a literary magazine. Have an opinion, a specific point to make, and have fun writing about it. You must resist the urge to summarize the readings (we have summarizers to do that!).

    2. **Questioners:** The questioners will post 4-5 questions that will help guide discussion for that class. Questions should be at different scales, but nothing to nit-picky. We will explicitly talk about why some questions are better than others, and pursue the most interesting ones. Don't ask questions that actually have an obvious factual answer, but questions that help us think critically about the readings. Coming up with good questions is much harder than it sounds, which is why it's good to practice it.

    3. **Summarizers:** The summarizers will prepare a ~8-point summary of the assigned reading, of what they took to be the significant points. I expect all summarizers to make contributions at the beginning of class as a way of reminding everyone what they've read. Be sure that you prepare enough to have something original to say in conjunction with other summarizers.

    4. **Slackers:** Enjoy your day off.

  - On your assignments, I will assign and post to your assignment a numerical score as follows:
    - 3: fulfilled minimum requirements (word count and coherence)
    - 5: basic effort, but underwhelming (C)
    - 7: solid work (B)
    - 9: excellent work (A)
    - 10: truly outstanding (A+)

- **Historiography guidebook** (33%)
Previous iterations of this course have created essays on historiographical topics for a lower-division historiography course. Each student will contribute revisions to an existing essay and create a new essay on a topic of their choice.


## Get feedback whenever you want
**Please talk to me about your grade at any time**, and as often as you'd like. Please do not email about this; a conversation is far more useful and efficient and avoids misunderstandings. Right before or after class is a good time, as well as office hours.


## Submitting Work
We will store our work at [https://github.com/unm-historiography/2019-fall](https://github.com/unm-historiography/2019-fall). We'll talk more about this in class, but instructions are [here](http://fredgibbs.net/courses/etc/github-instructions.html). Repeated failure to post work for the class in the appropriate manner (without discussing with me the reasons why) will result in you being dropped from the course.


## Required Readings
Although I have kept the reading load to a reasonable level (kind of low for an upper-level history course), some readings can quite dense and conceptually challenging, and you will be turning in work before 3 out of 4 classes. This emphasis on thinking and writing is by design, as a capstone course for the history department. Be honest with yourself about whether you have time to fit this course into your busy schedule. One of the goals of the course is that you will learn to read, absorb, and think critically about information more easily and quickly than you can already. That skill is hard-earned, and only comes with practice.
