## Course Description
What does it mean to “make history”? On one hand, to do something worth recording. On the other, the act of memorializing. This course examines how we interact with history everyday, through social media, Wikipedia, film, books, public spaces, monuments, historic buildings, art, and so on. Where is it visible? Invisible? What difference does it make?

The core philosophy underlying the course is that historical perspective is essential for the educated citizen. We consider the difference between history and memory, how history has been used in the past to manipulate public memory, and how the study of history has been at the center of recent culture wars.

We will also explore various meta-questions about history: What is history? What is it for? Who is it for? This entirely online and asynchronous course consists of short lectures, reading assignments, quizzes, and short essays that helps students learn robust research skills, analytical techniques, and ways of using evidence to make arguments.



## Student Learning Outcomes (SLOs)
Through readings, lectures, discussions, examinations, and writing assignments, students will be able to:

*  EXPLAIN how humans in the past shaped their own unique historical moments, constructed historical memories, and were shaped by those moments and memories over time.
* SUMMARIZE and APPRAISE the diversity of historical experiences, interpretations, evidence in order to RECONSTRUCT past events and EVALUATE how history and historical memory can be used and misused for various purposes.
* IDENTIFY historical arguments in a variety of sources and EXPLAIN how they were constructed, EVALUATING credibility, perspective, and relevance.
* CREATE well-supported historical arguments and narratives that demonstrate their ability to read critically, think logically, and express themselves clearly in writing appropriate for their audience.
* DISTINGUISH between primary and secondary sources, IDENTIFY and EVALUATE evidence and UNDERSTAND people in their historical context.

### Please Ask for Help
I heartily encouraged you to speak with me at any time about how I think you're doing in the class and how you can improve your performance (if at all). If life gets overwhelming during the course (as it easily can these days), it can be tempting to drift away from an elective course like this. Rather than disappear, let's work something out to accommodate your circumstances and thus avoid digging a huge hole from which it becomes increasingly difficult to escape.
