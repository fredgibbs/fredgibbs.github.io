# HIST 1105: Links and Guides
This page contains links that you will need at some point. There's nothing new on this page---all these links appear on the syllabus as well (usually in multiple places)---but it can be sometimes helpful to have everything in one place.

## Submitting Work
All work will be submitted through UNM Learn, primarily the Discussion Board. The quizzes are of course there as well. The best way to get to both is via the left nav bar once logged into our course on Learn.

## Readings
We use a tool called Zotero to manage PDFs of reading assignments apart from the books. As you read the [Zotero set up instructions](/courses/etc/zotero), you will need the following links. Save yourself confusion by reading the directions FIRST.

Our `Zotero Group homepage` is [https://www.zotero.org/groups/2703269/making-history-unm](https://www.zotero.org/groups/2703269/making-history-unm). This link is best for joining the course Zotero Group.

Our `Zotero Library page` is [https://www.zotero.org/groups/2703269/making-history-unm/library](https://www.zotero.org/groups/2703269/making-history-unm/library). Once you are a member of our group, this link is best for accessing our Zotero Library.

## Videos
All course videos will appear on the [course YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5BwgfElqNYEIpBEB1mwpHA). There should be links on the syllabus under the day it they are published as well.
