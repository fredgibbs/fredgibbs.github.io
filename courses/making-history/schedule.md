# HIST 1105: Readings & Assignments


### Submitting work
All work will be submitted on UNM Learn, either through the discussion board or via a quiz.

### A note about deadlines
Everything you need to turn in is listed in a red box. Most weeks have short reading quizzes or reflections due on specified days to keep everyone moving along together and space out the work. But I am also aware that sh!t happens and takes up valuable time unexpectedly. If need be, you can submit work up to TWO DAYS after the due date for full credit IF THE NEED ARISES. But this leeway should be used only as a last resort in the wake of unusual circumstances. Because there is a natural tendency to let things slide until the last weeks of the semester, unless you've made arrangements with me (and please do!), **work more than 2 days late will be scored a 0**.


## Week 1 (Jan 18--22): Introductions

### Tuesday: Syllabus, Expectations, Tools
- [Welcome to Making History video](https://youtu.be/mgmTIOIj3n4)
- [Syllabus overview video](https://youtu.be/5ZQi1_jYEhg)

{% include alert.html class='warning' title='Do this ASAP' text="
We use a tool called Zotero to manage PDFs of reading assignments apart from the books. As you read the [Zotero set up instructions](/courses/etc/zotero), you will need the following links. Save yourself confusion by reading the directions FIRST. We use Zotero throughout the semester---and occasionally I add stuff to this during the semester that we'll use for an assignment---so don't be foolish enough to think you can get by without it.

Our `Zotero Group homepage` is [https://www.zotero.org/groups/2703269/making-history-unm](https://www.zotero.org/groups/2703269/making-history-unm). This link is best for joining the course Zotero Group.

Our `Zotero Library page` is [https://www.zotero.org/groups/2703269/making-history-unm/library](https://www.zotero.org/groups/2703269/making-history-unm/library). Once you are a member of our group, this link is best for accessing our Zotero Library.

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Syllabus Quiz' text="
- Make sure you watch the intro videos (one on the course, one on the syllabus) and take the quiz that covers both videos and the syllabus. Questions cover important logistics of the course and are super easy points that you don't want to miss out on! The video links will be posted no later than Tuesday morning, and you can take the quiz anytime this week.
"%}


### Wednesday
- Alice Dreger, [What is History?](http://alicedreger.com/what_is_history).
The significance of the anecdote offered at the beginning of this piece is not explicitly stated, but it should be. The point here is that every time we ask WHY? about anything, we can focus either on immediate practical implications (physics), or on much larger structural, social explanations (history). They are both important because they provide different kinds of answers. Those who can move fluidly between these ways of thinking and understanding will be more astute problem solvers in any career.

- Peter Sterns, [Why Study History?](https://www.historians.org/about-aha-and-membership/aha-history-and-archives/historical-archives/why-study-history-(1998)).


{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Introductory Connections' text="
USING THE READINGS FOR THIS WEEK---and as a way of getting to know each other just a little bit---answer the following (~200 words): What kinds of history to you find interesting? What reasons for studying history have appealed to you (even if you didn't think explicitly about them until now)?

GIMICK ALERT: Just for fun (apologies if this ends up being stupid), we're going to try to connect all our responses together. I'm going to start a thread on the Learn Discussion Board, and everyone is going to reply to the person who posted immediately before them. You don't need to respond directly or in depth to what the person says, but try your best to connect your post to the previous one. The post you will respond to will probably mention a historical topic or period that you're familiar with (or really dislike), or have been meaning to learn more about (or intend to avoid), and you can use that as your connection. You and your connection might like totally different topics for the same reason or the same topic for very different reasons.
"%}



### Friday
- David Foster Wallace, [What is Water?](https://fs.blog/2012/04/david-foster-wallace-this-is-water). You can listen to DFW read this (a commencement speech at Kenyon College in 2005) or just read the transcript---or read and listen at the same time, as I did.

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='What is Water Reflection' text="
This assignment is a standard [reading reflection](reading-reflections), where you should answer the prompts
- What ideas or phrases resonated with you?
- What have you worshipped even if you never thought it about it that way?
- Most importantly: how is history useful in achieving the goals outlined in the speech?
"%}


## Week 2 (Jan 25--29): Premodern history writing
To understand more about what history is and what it is for, it's imperative to have a sense of how historical methods, motivations, and interpretations have changed over time. That's what our first book is about. It's a very high-level overview that helps keep the big picture of historiographical change in focus. Short lectures and reading guides will complement the text with additional details and historic examples. This book provides a foundation of historical tradition that is necessary to appreciate the critical questions and changes in historical writing that are the focus of our second book.

Popkin's book is very good at making its main points very clear while providing lots of historical examples and detail, so it's easy to read slower when getting the more important overview and read more quickly through the details. Don't treat it like a textbook where everything is equally important.


### Monday
- No specific readings for today, but you might start reading the Popkin chapters for this week.
- Watch the [comments on interesting questions you raised in your introductions](https://youtu.be/jmZomS3_Lj4). See if you're mentioned in it!
- Watch the [lecture on historiography and this week's readings](https://youtu.be/iIdyvQvYPaQ).


{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Lecture Quiz' text="
- This quiz is on Learn like the syllabus quiz, and don't forget that you can debate quiz questions marked incorrect. Be sure you have specific evidence and make an argument!
"%}

### Wednesday
- Popkin, Chapter 2: History in Ancient and Medieval Times, 26--48.

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Reading Quiz' text="
Some questions to keep in mind while reading and in preparing for the quiz:
- How would you describe the differences between Herodotus and Thucydides?
- What were Roman historians trying to accomplish?
- How did Judiasm and Christianity challenge the kinds of history writing?
- How would you characterize histories written during later Middle Ages?
"%}


### Friday
- Popkin, Chapter 3: The Historiographical Revolution of Early Modern Europe, 49--70.

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Reading reflection' text="
Below are a few questions you should address in your [reading reflection](reading-responses). For each point that you want to make, give at least one specific example:
- How did Renaissance humanism impact historical methods and writing?
- Pages 53--61 gives us a bunch of examples of kinds of histories and influences on history writing. How would you summarize what changes are happening in society and in the writing of history?
- How are Enlightenment historians doing things differently than before? How did the aims of historians and their histories change?
"%}



## Week 3 (Feb 1--5): The rise of modern history
This week we continue our historiographical survey.


### Monday
- [Week 2 Overview video](https://youtu.be/isu3ia2G0r0). This one is good for making sure you haven't missed key historiographical points that we'll need later, and some advice about doing well on the quizzes.
- [Week 3 Overview video](https://youtu.be/FKo0RlWskqs). This one is good for situating the two chapters in the contours of the course and for highlighting some important ideas you'll need for your Wednesday reflection.

{% include alert.html class='warning' title='Lecture quiz' text="
Originally we had a lecture quiz scheduled for today, but that is CANCELED! Nothing due today. However, the lecture video will help you score higher on the Wednesday reflection.
"%}


### Wednesday
- Popkin, Chapter 4: Rise of Academic Scholarship and Nationalist History, 71--100.

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Reading reflection' text="
A few broad questions to (paradoxically) answer in your reflection:
- How did history become 'professionalized' and more 'scientific' in the 19th century (which we more or less know as 'academic' history today?)
- How would you describe the relationship between history and nationalism as formulated in the 19th century?
"%}


### Friday
- Popkin, Chapter 5: Scientific History in an Era of Conflict, 101--129.

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Reading Quiz' text="
Your quiz will cover the whole chapter as usual, but will focus on one particular question: Why was there a tension between 'scientific' history and global conflicts happening in the early 20th century?
"%}




## Week 4 (Feb 8--12)
We finish up our historiographical survey this week. This week's chapters cover how approaches to history changed in the second half of the 20th century. We are taking a short break from reading responses in favor of READING SUMMARIES. They are described below.


### Monday
{% include alert.html class='warning' title='Nothing due today' text="
No video, no quiz, nada. Nothing due for today! Use the time to produce better reading summaries due this week.
"%}


### Wednesday
- Popkin, Chapter 6: From Objectivity to the "Culture Wars", 133--148 (beginning of the chapter up to section titled "Women's History...").
- Maza, _Thinking about History_, 178--185 (Chapter 5, from section "In Search of Meaning: Microhistory" to "Clifford Geertz...").

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Reading Summary' text="
Using both readings, make a bullet point list of what you consider the most important historical changes described in the chapter. These should be in your own words---don't just copy sentences out of the book---and you should have ~8--10 bullet points. Bullet points should be COMPLETE sentences, and you can have more than one sentence in a single bullet to make more complex points. Make sure each bullet is a separate topic.
"%}


### Friday
- Popkin, Chapter 6: From Objectivity to the "Culture Wars", 148--170 (from section titled "Women's History..." to end of chapter).

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Reading Summary' text="
Same thing as Wednesday (but for today's assignment, obviously).
"%}




## Week 5 (Feb 15--19)
Our next book (though we briefly dabbled in it already) introduces and explains some critical questions that we should always be asking about every history we encounter. It covers some of the same material as Popkin's final chapters, but in a very different way. Unlike the broad chronological overview Popkin gives us, Maza takes a more thematic approach to analyzing contemporary history writing and what's new about it compared to past traditions. We will apply these questions (and historical examples) to analyzing our final book for the course towards the end of the term. These first two chapters are especially useful for our exercise next week examining how US History should be taught.



### Monday
- [Popkin BIGPOINTS + History as Literature](https://youtu.be/5eJEk5Z2egI)

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Lecture Quiz' text="
- Review/Preview Lecture Quiz (via Learn as always)
"%}


### Wednesday
- Maza, _Thinking about History_, Ch. 1: The History of Whom?, 10--44 (whole chapter).

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Reading Reflection' text="
WHOM has history been about? How has this changed over time? What shifts do you find most interesting and WHY?
"%}


### Friday
- Maza, _Thinking about History_, Ch. 2: The History of Where?, 45--82 (whole chapter).

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Reading Reflection' text="
WHERE has history been about? How has this changed over time? What shifts do you find most interesting and WHY?
"%}




## Week 6 (Feb 22--26)
Having completed our historiographical survey (Popkin) and started to think about critical historical questions (Maza, and her first two chapters are especially relevant for this week), we can reflect more thoughtfully on our own historiographical moment. How should we conceptualize and write about U.S. history?

There are NO DAILY ASSIGNMENTS for this week, just one longer-than-normal reflection essay due on Friday that should demonstrate your familiarity with everything listed below. I have recommended doing work on certain days to space everything out, but you can decide what works for your schedule. HOWEVER, be sure you understand what you need to do for Friday EARLY in the week so that you have time to get everything done.


### Monday
- Browse quickly the [full issue of the _New York Times Magazine_ 1619 Project](https://pulitzercenter.org/sites/default/files/full_issue_of_the_1619_project.pdf) (Aug 26, 2019). The goal here is to get a sense of entire publication---namely what it covers, what it doesn't, and what perspectives the editors and contributors promote.

- Nikole Hannah-Jones, [The Idea of America](https://pulitzercenter.org/sites/default/files/the_idea_of_america_full_essay.pdf). An easier-to-read-online version, but without images, is [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20200131161717/https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/08/14/magazine/black-history-american-democracy.html).


### Wednesday
The following two responses to the _NYTM_ issue (and reactions to it) are online, but sometimes access can be limited. In case you can't access the articles through the links below, they are also in our Zotero library.
- Adam Serwer, "[The Fight Over the 1619 Project Is Not About the Facts](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/12/historians-clash-1619-project/604093/)", _The Atlantic_, December 23, 2019.
- Conor Friedersdorf, "[1776 Honors America’s Diversity in a Way 1619 Does Not](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/01/inclusive-case-1776-not-1619/604435/)", _The Atlantic_, January 6, 2020.


### Friday
After browsing the full issue, reading Hannah-Jones's introduction, and reading through the two different perspectives on how we should view the project, write a 800-900 word essay to answer the following TWO questions (using roughly half your space for each, but don't sweat the exact ratio):
- How would you summarize/characterize the pros and cons of what the project is trying to do?
- What is YOUR view of how this historiographical debate fits into the long history of historiography that we've been reading?

WARNING: Make specific use of ALL READINGS THIS WEEK to inform your response. Don't just rant for or against the project or make bland generalizations about how it's great or stupid without engaging with the arguments from the readings. There is no right answer, but there are better and worse ways of making an informed argument, and that's what your grade depends on.

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='1619 Project Reflection' text="
As noted above, two questions:
- How would you summarize/characterize the pros (advantages) and cons (disadvantages) of what the 1619 Project is trying to do? You should try to address equally (and objectively) both sides of the debate in your post, regardless of your own feelings about it. USE ALL THE READINGS!
- What is YOUR view of how this historiographical debate about U.S. history (and how we should tell it) fits into the long history of historiography that we've been studying? There is no right answer, but your opinion should be directly grounded in the readings. Citations are a good way of visualizing how well you're doing that.

---

#### More words, more points
As a heftier weekly reflection, your 1619 Project reflection (800-900 words) is worth up to 30 points (not counting extra credit, as usual). It uses the same grading rubric as the usual weekly reflections. Be aware that the challenge is NOT simply to fill up the space but to provide thoughtful answers to the questions BASED ON THE READINGS.
"%}




## Week 7 (March 1--5)
This week we're back to Maza, and in fact mostly finishing with it. We're reading chapters 3 and 4 carefully this week, but just skimming 5 and 6 next week. Because everything starts to get a little crazy this time of the semester, don't fret about the specific recommended due dates this week---just BE SURE TO GET EVERYTHING IN BY FRIDAY (or Saturday if you're hopelessly behind, as I seem to be this semester). There is a video wrap-up (and quiz) on the 1619 Project critiques, but it doesn't really need to (and won't) address the Maza chapters, so you can treat them independently.


### Tuesday-ish
- 1619 Project Critique [Commentary Video](https://youtu.be/KM-_68hAlIo) and QUIZ.
This video highlights some of the interesting points made in your essays from last week, and serves as a jumping off point for ideas I hope you'll take away from our readings and critique.

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Lecture Quiz' text="
- 1619 Project Critique Lecture Quiz (via Learn as always)
"%}


### Wednesday-ish
- Sara Maza, _Thinking about History_, Ch. 3: The History of What?, 83--117 (whole chapter).

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Reading Reflection' text="
As Maza explains early in the chapter, history has traditionally been about people, but more recently it's been about a lot of other stuff.  Two questions:
- What kinds of things have historians started to study and what did they think they could tell us that \"traditional\" histories could not? BRIEFLY, which examples did you think were most interesting?
- Use the last few chapters of Popkin in addition to Maza's Chapter 3 to explain how interests in some of the things that you mentioned in part 1 came to be. How were they part of broader historiographical change?
"%}

### Friday-ish
- Sara Maza, _Thinking about History_, Ch. 4: How is History Produced?, 118--156 (whole chapter).

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Reading Reflection' text="
- What are the key similarities between academic and popular/public history? What are the key differences?
- Explain how (according to David Lowenthal [p.131]) \"heritage is history's opposite\". Explain how it isn't.
- Joining the last two sections of the chapter: How are archives transformed into history? How can very different historical interpretations come from the same sources?
"%}


## Week 8 (Mar 8--12)
We're finishing Maza this week, but there are no individual chapter reflections as we've done previously. As a few weeks ago, NOTHING DUE UNTIL FRIDAY as we're winding down for break. Because your assignment this week is to reflect over Maza as a whole, it's important to be familiar with the final two chapters (5 and 6), but we don't need to read for the same level of detail.


### Early in the week
- SKIM MAZA chapters 5 and 6. We've already read a chunk of 5, and 6 overlaps with Popkin (so there's not a lot that's new), but it is explained a bit differently. Again, the overlap will help you better see what historiographic changes brought up in Popkin are most important. You should read to get familiar with her main points and examples rather than absorb all the details.

There is no quiz or reflection on just these chapters, but there is one last reflection on the whole Maza book to close out this half of the term.

### Friday
{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Reading Reflection' text="
- This is a double (in length and points) reflection: 600 words, worth 20 pts.
- How did Maza's approach (using thematic questions) to survey recent historiographical changes help you learn more about historiography than you could/did via Popkin? GIVE EXAMPLES!
- How was this approach more limiting and/or confusing than Popkin's survey? GIVE EXAMPLES!
- Ask AT LEAST TWO QUESTIONS about the first half of the course. Is there something you're still confused about? Did you think the books contradicted each other on certain points? Is there something you want to know more about? These questions will be the basis for our warm-up lecture AFTER BREAK.
"%}

Be sure you are providing SPECIFIC examples in addition to generic statements. To say "Maza is useful because it's organized by question" is basically saying to me that you have no idea what's in the book.

Remember, it's a REFLECTION, not a summary. Any brief summary should be in the service of providing examples and illustrating your informed opinion on the questions. I'm looking for your familiarity with the Maza book as a whole; there is a not a list of stuff you're supposed to mention.



## Week 9: Mar 15--19: Spring Break!
Enjoy the break! And start reading _Seven Cheap Things_ to make life easier over the next month! See Week 11 for a brief introduction.




## Week 10 (Mar 22--26):  Monuments and Architecture
Welcome back!

Before we dive into our final book for the course, I thought it would be useful to think about how history is written out in buildings and monuments all around us.

There are no daily assignments for this week, just one slightly-longer-than-usual reflection (~600 words/20 points) due on Friday. After reading Monteiro and her argument for the power of architecture and monuments to promote white supremacism, read through the essays about Confederate monuments in the _Civil War Monitor_ and whether they should be left in place or removed. Thanks to our TA Chase for the suggestion and PDF of the _CWM_.

- [First half wrap-up video](https://youtu.be/p6vFHklZT0g)

- Lyra D. Monteiro, [Power Structures: White Columns, White Marble, White Supremacy](https://intersectionist.medium.com/american-power-structures-white-columns-white-marble-white-supremacy-d43aa091b5f9),” _Medium_, November 1, 2020.

- Selections from the _Civil War Monitor_ (in Zotero) on preserving Confederate monuments. The first and last essays are interesting but less on this debate specifically, so I would skim them quickly.

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Architecture and Monuments' text="
A two-part reflection for this week as we ramp up again. Like your final assignment before break, this reflection is double length (~600 words) and double points. In your response, answer the following:

1) Monteiro uses many specific examples to support her argument---no surprise to you that I would like that at this point, right? What do you see as the most important points that she makes about the links between architecture, monuments and white supremacy?

2) The _Civil War Monitor_ pieces are quite short and obviously can't do what Monteiro does in much more space. How useful is it to have several short essays with different points of view compared to a longer form article with a singular argument? Each form has its advantages and disadvantages, obviously, but which did you find more beneficial? Which (between Monteiro vs the _Monitor_) changed your understanding or thinking the most? WHY?
"%}




## Week 11: Mar 29--Apr 2
We're reading this book to critique its use of history, not because it's "right" (you can decide for yourself how much you agree or disagree with it). The book's goal is to offer a critique of capitalism, but that's beside the point for us. OUR goal is to apply the Maza book on how we should approach history to this specific text, which has a very particular way of using history. Thinking through how history is used here will help us be more informed and critical readers when we see history invoked in any context.

For each week, you'll have about 3 chapters to read. The number of pages per week seems high compared to what we've been doing but the book is a quick read and we're not reading it to learn specific information as we were before.

To keep on track, you'll submit a reading reflection on the assigned chapters at the end of each week (see box directly below), and that will be the only thing to turn in for the week. I will offer a few guiding questions for you to respond to, but you should feel free to address whatever aspects of the chapters are most interesting to you---but remember that the main goal is to make it clear to me that you're keeping up with the readings and reading carefully enough that you have an informed opinion about them.


{% include alert.html class='warning' title='Standard 7CT weekly reflection' text="
For the next few week you'll be submitting the same kind of reading reflection EACH FRIDAY. Although there is just one thing to turn in per week, your reflection should have distinct sections for each chapter. You should aim for about ~300 words per chapter, which is basically the same as the daily reflections that you were doing earlier. I encourage you to draft your chapter sections as you read them, but I think you will get ideas about how to improve them as you move through the set of chapters for the week, hence one submission per week. Also, it's just less stuff to post and more flexibility for reading on your own schedule, which isn't a bad thing at this point.

Feel free to write a little more or less in for each chapter in accordance with how much it resonated with you as long as you're getting close to ~900 words total. My goal with articulating a word count here is not to be a stickler about it, but to help avoid anyone unintentionally writing way too much or too little.

Your weekly reflection (due end of day Friday) should provide the following FOR EACH CHAPTER:
- ~3 non-cryptic bullet points of what you consider to be the main ideas for the chapter (don't just repeat that the \"thing\" discussed in the chapter is important; be more specific about what the authors are arguing)
- 1 idea/quote you found really interesting and WHY
- 1 idea/quote you found problematic and WHY
- A 3-5 sentence synopsis of how the chapter uses history both effectively and problematically.
  - Thinking about Maza's questions (Who, what, where, where, etc), what histories maybe _aren't_ being told or represented in the chapter?
  - How well does the evidence (ie historical examples) support the argument?  
- 1-2 questions that came to mind while/after reading the chapter

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Reading Reflection' text="
- For Chapters 6 and 7: I'd like you to do basically the standard _7CT_ weekly reflection, but WITHOUT the chapter synopsis (~200 words per chapter).
- Instead of writing up the same kind of thing for the short conclusion, it will be more useful to reflect on the whole book. For the last part of the weekly reflection, I want to read in ~500 words your INFORMED opinion on the book as a whole. How interesting/useful/unhelpful do you find the idea of \"cheapness\" and \"world-ecology\" as a way to understand the implications of capitalism?
- Don't automatically like or dislike the book because it supports or opposes your own opinion of capitalism. It is entirely possible to support capitalism 100% and still find the book useful. It is entirely possible to hate capitalism 100% and find the book's cheapness theme unconvincing or unhelpful. Personally, I think the authors are less interested in trying to make people dislike capitalism as much as hope to make people think more carefully about its implications and how to lessen negative impacts.
- For this week, stay focused on what the book actually says as opposed what you might find lacking (such as a recognition of capitalism's advantages over other economic systems). We'll get into that kind of critique next week. But it's not a useful critique just to say the book is biased. YES IT IS BIASED! But that in itself doesn't necessarily make it more or less effective at providing a new way of thinking about capitalism. So the challenge here is to stay focused on their approach in spite of the fact you're only getting one side of the story.
- You should end up with ~900 words total, the same length as your weekly reflections over the last few weeks.

## Week 14: Apr 19--23

This reflection is the same length and points (~900 words and 30 points) as you've been doing. It uses the same grading rubric we've been using all semester. You should address the following questions:

- How would you situate _Seven Cheap Things_ in the historiographic tradition that we read about the first half of the term? How does it represent postmodern history? How does it represent previous historiographical traditions?
- Are the historical examples cited sufficient evidence to convince you of the authors' arguments about cheap things?
- Should this book be considered history? Or merely historical? Give examples from the book and previous readings to support your position?
