# HIST 1105: Readings & Assignments

### A note about deadlines
Everything you need to turn in is listed in a red box. Many weeks have short reading reflections due on specified days to keep everyone moving along together and space out the work. But I am also aware that sh!t happens and takes up valuable time unexpectedly. As long as you are USUALLY meeting the deadlines, you can submit work up to TWO DAYS after the due date for full credit if the need arises. But this leeway should be used only as a last resort in the wake of unusual circumstances. Unless you've made arrangements with me (and please do!), work more than 2 days late will be scored a 0.


## Week 1 (Jan 18--22): Introductions

### Monday: Syllabus, Expectations, Tools
- Welcome address and lecture/syllabus quiz
- Introduction to [Zotero](http://zotero.org)

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Do this ASAP' text="
Before you start doing any reading or assignments for the course, follow the [Zotero setup instructions](http://fredgibbs.net/courses/etc/zotero), and make sure you can access the required course readings there. We use this library throughout the semester---and occasionally I add stuff to this during the semester that we'll use for an assignment---so don't be foolish enough to think you can get by without it.

### Understanding History and its uses
- Alice Dreger, [What is History?](http://alicedreger.com/what_is_history).
The significance of the anecdote offered at the beginning of this piece is not explicitly stated, although it should be. The point here is that every time we ask WHY? about anything, we can focus on immediate practical implications (physics), or much larger structural, social explanations (history). They are both important because they provide different kinds of answers. Those who can move fluidly between these ways of thinking and understanding will be more astute problem solvers in any career.

- Peter Sterns, [Why Study History](https://www.historians.org/about-aha-and-membership/aha-history-and-archives/historical-archives/why-study-history-(1998\)).

- Popkin, Chapter 1: What is Historiography?, 15--25.
This chapter outlines some interesting reasons for studying history and briefly explains different _kinds_ of history. The books makes a well-intentioned effort to not be exclusively Western, but it really is, and so the few brief non-Western sections here seem a bit forced. Don't skip them, but don't worry about the details.

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Introductory Connections' text="
Drawing from the set of readings for this introductory week, and as a way of getting to know each other just a little bit, answer the following : What kinds of history to you find interesting? What reasons for studying history have appealed to you (even if you didn't think explicitly about them until now)?

GIMICK ALERT: Just for fun (apologies if this ends up being stupid), we're going to try to connect all our responses together. I'm going to start a thread on the Learn Discussion Board, and everyone is going to reply to the person who posted immediately before them. You don't need to respond directly or in depth to what the person says, but try your best to connect your post to the last one you can see in the thread. The post you will respond to will probably mention a historical topic or period that you're familiar with (or really dislike), or have been meaning to learn more about (or intend to avoid), and you can use that as your connection. You and your connection might like totally different topics for the same reason or the same topic for very different reasons.

Standard reflection length (~200--250 words); 3 possible points for taking it seriously.

## Week 2 (Jan 25--29): Premodern history writing
To understand more about what history is and what it is for, it is VERY useful to have a sense of how historical methods, goals, and writing has changed over time. That's what our first book is about. It's a very high-level overview that helps keep the big picture in focus. Short lectures and reading guides will complement the text with additional details and historic examples.

{% include alert.html class='warning' title='Due this week' text="
As we get up to speed, you have very straightforward (if a bit dull) slate of work for this week. But it gives me a chance to hear everyone's voice and respond right out of the gate.
- MONDAY: lecture quiz
- WEDNESDAY: reading reflection
- FRIDAY: reading reflection
"%}


### Monday
- No specific readings for today, but you might start reading the Popkin chapters for this week.
- "Why care about historiography" LECTURE and QUIZ.


### Wednesday
- Popkin, Chapter 2: History in Ancient and Medieval Times, 26--48.

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Reading reflection' text="
- How would you describe the differences between Herodotus and Thucydides?
- What were Roman historians trying to accomplish?
- How did Judiasm and Christianity challenge the kinds of history writing done to that point?
- How would you characterize histories written during later Middle Ages?
"%}


### Friday
- Popkin, Chapter 3: The Historiographical Revolution of Early Modern Europe, 49--70.

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Reading reflection' text="
- How did Renaissance humanism impact historical methods and writing?
"%}



## Week 3 (Feb 1--5): The rise of modern history
This week we're continuing and finishing our historiographical survey. The plan is to have a short (~5 minute) introductory lecture and lecture/reading quiz for each chapter. Quizzes will employ a variety of kinds of questions, including short answer prompts that test your ability to synthesize information from the lecture and chapter.

{% include alert.html class='warning' title='Due this week' text="
Less writing this week, but the quizzes will test your familiarity with the lectures and readings, as well as help emphasize what I think are the most important points to take away for the topic.
- M, W, F: Lecture/reading QUIZ
"%}


### Monday
- Popkin, Chapter 4: Rise of Academic Scholarship and Nationalist History, 71--100.

### Wednesday
- Popkin, Chapter 5: Scientific History in an Era of Conflict, 101--129.

### Friday
- Popkin, Chapter 6: From Objectivity to the "Culture Wars", 133--170.




## Week 4 (Feb 8--12): 1619 Project discussion
Now that our historiographical survey is complete, we can reflect more thoughtfully on our own moment of historiography.

{% include alert.html class='warning' title='Reading reflection' text="
There are no daily assignments for this week, just one reflection essay due on Friday on everything listed below.
- FRIDAY: Project Critique
"%}

- Browse quickly the [full issue of the _New York Times Magazine_ 1619 Project](https://pulitzercenter.org/sites/default/files/full_issue_of_the_1619_project.pdf) (Aug 26, 2019). The goal here is to get a sense of entire publication---namely what it covers, what it doesn't, and what perspectives the authors promote.

- Nikole Hannah-Jones, [The Idea of America](https://pulitzercenter.org/sites/default/files/the_idea_of_america_full_essay.pdf). An easier-to-read-online version, but without images, is [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20200131161717/https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/08/14/magazine/black-history-american-democracy.html). This statement

The following two responses to the _NYTM_ issue and its aftermath are online, but sometimes access can be limited. They are in our Zotero library.
- Adam Serwer, "The Fight Over the 1619 Project Is Not About the Facts", _The Atlantic_, December 23, 2019.
- Conor Friedersdorf, "1776 Honors America’s Diversity in a Way 1619 Does Not", _The Atlantic_, January 6, 2020.


### Friday
After browsing the full issue, reading Hannah-Jones's introduction, and reading through the two different perspectives on how we should view the project: How would you characterize the pros and cons of what the project is trying to do?

WARNING: Make specific use of ALL READINGS to inform your response. Don't just rant for or against the project or make bland generalizations about how it's great or stupid without engaging with the arguments from the readings. There is no right answer, but there are better and worse ways of making an informed argument, and that's what I'm evaluating you on.

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Project Reflection' text="
How would you characterize the pros (advantages) and cons (disadvantages) of what the project is trying to do? You should try to address equally (and objectively) both sides of the debate in your post, regardless of your own feelings about it.

Your 1619 Project reflection should be around ~800 words and is worth up to 10 points (not counting extra credit, as usual).
"%}



## Week 5: Feb 15--19
Rather than moving chronologically, our next book moves thematically across key questions that we should always be asking about every history we encounter. It sort of picks up where the other book leaves off (with some helpful overlap), and largely focuses on contemporary history writing and what's new about it.

- Southgate, _What is History For?_, 7: Histories for Postmodernity, 133--153.



## Week 12: Apr 5--9
Remember, we're reading this book to critique its use of history, not because it's "right" (you can decide for yourself how much you agree or disagree with it). The book's goal is to offer a critique of capitalism, but that's beside the point for us. OUR goal is to apply our discussion about what history is for to this point to this specific text that has a very particular way of using history. Critically thinking through how history is used here will help us be more informed readers when we see history invoked in any context.

For each week, you'll have a couple chapters to read and will submit a reading reflection on the assigned pages. I will offer a few guiding questions for you to respond to, but you should feel free to address whatever aspects of the chapters are most interesting to you provided that you're making it clear to me that you're keeping up with the readings.
