Write a slightly-longer-than-normal-comment (600-800 words) about your take on postmodern history. Write/focus on whatever you like, but provide at least rough answers to the following kinds of questions (but don't just answer them one by one):
- How have our readings affected the way you think about history?
- Does postmodern history constitute a historiographical paradigm shift?
- Are late twentieth-century ways of writing about history that we've discussed a 'rupture' from previous historiographies?
- Or are they more on a continuum of historiographical change.
**These comments will be VERY useful for our Intro Guide.**
"%}



## Week 11: Mar 29--Apr 2


### Discursive History
* Foucault, _Archeology of Knowledge_, 3-17; 21-30; 31-39.

### Narrative history

- Alex Rosenberg, [Why most narrative history is wrong](https://www.salon.com/2018/10/07/why-most-narrative-history-is-wrong/)

* Kieran Healy, "Fuck nuance", 1-13.

{% include alert.html class='info' title='Discussion prep' text="
Here are some questions to consider, but write a general comment on these topics rather than give specific answers (which you can't do well in only 400 words).

  - Do you reject my premise that this article applies equally well to history?
  - Is all historical study except the 'universal' histories predominant before Ranke a matter of nuance?
  - Besides making for a good story, is there value in historical work that simply adds nuance to widely accepted understandings of the past?
  - How should the scale of a historical study be used in understanding its value? (= what is history for? [see next week])
  - Is history well served by models? (also: do you need math to have models?)
  - Will the rise of a digital archive make historical laws more attractive to historians?
  - How might a digital archive challenge traditional historical authority?
