# HIST 1105: Readings & Assignments


### Submitting work
All work will be submitted on UNM Learn, either through the discussion board or via a quiz.

### A note about deadlines
Everything you need to turn in is listed in a red box. Most weeks have short reading quizzes or reflections due on specified days to keep everyone moving along together and space out the work. But I am also aware that sh!t happens and takes up valuable time unexpectedly. If need be, you can submit work up to TWO DAYS after the due date for full credit IF THE NEED ARISES. But this leeway should be used only as a last resort in the wake of unusual circumstances. Because there is a natural tendency to let things slide until the last weeks of the semester, unless you've made arrangements with me (and please do!), **work more than 2 days late will be scored a 0**.


## Week 1 (Jan 18--22): Introductions

### Tuesday: Syllabus, Expectations, Tools
- [Welcome to Making History video](https://youtu.be/mgmTIOIj3n4)
- [Syllabus overview video](https://youtu.be/5ZQi1_jYEhg)

{% include alert.html class='warning' title='Do this ASAP' text="
We use a tool called Zotero to manage PDFs of reading assignments apart from the books. As you read the [Zotero set up instructions](/courses/etc/zotero), you will need the following links. Save yourself confusion by reading the directions FIRST. We use Zotero throughout the semester---and occasionally I add stuff to this during the semester that we'll use for an assignment---so don't be foolish enough to think you can get by without it.

Our `Zotero Group homepage` is [https://www.zotero.org/groups/2703269/making-history-unm](https://www.zotero.org/groups/2703269/making-history-unm). This link is best for joining the course Zotero Group.

Our `Zotero Library page` is [https://www.zotero.org/groups/2703269/making-history-unm/library](https://www.zotero.org/groups/2703269/making-history-unm/library). Once you are a member of our group, this link is best for accessing our Zotero Library.

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Syllabus Quiz' text="
- Make sure you watch the intro videos (one on the course, one on the syllabus) and take the quiz that covers both videos and the syllabus. Questions cover important logistics of the course and are super easy points that you don't want to miss out on! The video links will be posted no later than Tuesday morning, and you can take the quiz anytime this week.
"%}


### Wednesday
- Alice Dreger, [What is History?](http://alicedreger.com/what_is_history).
The significance of the anecdote offered at the beginning of this piece is not explicitly stated, but it should be. The point here is that every time we ask WHY? about anything, we can focus either on immediate practical implications (physics), or on much larger structural, social explanations (history). They are both important because they provide different kinds of answers. Those who can move fluidly between these ways of thinking and understanding will be more astute problem solvers in any career.

- Peter Sterns, [Why Study History?](https://www.historians.org/about-aha-and-membership/aha-history-and-archives/historical-archives/why-study-history-(1998)).


{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Introductory Connections' text="
USING THE READINGS FOR THIS WEEK---and as a way of getting to know each other just a little bit---answer the following (~200 words): What kinds of history to you find interesting? What reasons for studying history have appealed to you (even if you didn't think explicitly about them until now)?

GIMICK ALERT: Just for fun (apologies if this ends up being stupid), we're going to try to connect all our responses together. I'm going to start a thread on the Learn Discussion Board, and everyone is going to reply to the person who posted immediately before them. You don't need to respond directly or in depth to what the person says, but try your best to connect your post to the previous one. The post you will respond to will probably mention a historical topic or period that you're familiar with (or really dislike), or have been meaning to learn more about (or intend to avoid), and you can use that as your connection. You and your connection might like totally different topics for the same reason or the same topic for very different reasons.
"%}



### Friday
- David Foster Wallace, [What is Water?](https://fs.blog/2012/04/david-foster-wallace-this-is-water). You can listen to DFW read this (a commencement speech at Kenyon College in 2005) or just read the transcript---or read and listen at the same time, as I did.

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='What is Water Reflection' text="
This assignment is a standard [reading reflection](reading-reflections), where you should answer the prompts
- What ideas or phrases resonated with you?
- What have you worshipped even if you never thought it about it that way?
- Most importantly: how is history useful in achieving the goals outlined in the speech?
"%}


## Week 2 (Jan 25--29): Premodern history writing
To understand more about what history is and what it is for, it's imperative to have a sense of how historical methods, motivations, and interpretations have changed over time. That's what our first book is about. It's a very high-level overview that helps keep the big picture of historiographical change in focus. Short lectures and reading guides will complement the text with additional details and historic examples. This book provides a foundation of historical tradition that is necessary to appreciate the critical questions and changes in historical writing that are the focus of our second book.

Popkin's book is very good at making its main points very clear while providing lots of historical examples and detail, so it's easy to read slower when getting the more important overview and read more quickly through the details. Don't treat it like a textbook where everything is equally important.


### Monday
- No specific readings for today, but you might start reading the Popkin chapters for this week.
- Watch the [comments on interesting questions you raised in your introductions](https://youtu.be/jmZomS3_Lj4). See if you're mentioned in it!
- Watch the [lecture on historiography and this week's readings](https://youtu.be/iIdyvQvYPaQ).


{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Lecture Quiz' text="
- This quiz is on Learn like the syllabus quiz, and don't forget that you can debate quiz questions marked incorrect. Be sure you have specific evidence and make an argument!
"%}

### Wednesday
- Popkin, Chapter 2: History in Ancient and Medieval Times, 26--48.

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Reading Quiz' text="
Some questions to keep in mind while reading and in preparing for the quiz:
- How would you describe the differences between Herodotus and Thucydides?
- What were Roman historians trying to accomplish?
- How did Judiasm and Christianity challenge the kinds of history writing?
- How would you characterize histories written during later Middle Ages?
"%}


### Friday
- Popkin, Chapter 3: The Historiographical Revolution of Early Modern Europe, 49--70.

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Reading reflection' text="
Below are a few questions you should address in your [reading reflection](reading-responses). For each point that you want to make, give at least one specific example:
- How did Renaissance humanism impact historical methods and writing?
- Pages 53--61 gives us a bunch of examples of kinds of histories and influences on history writing. How would you summarize what changes are happening in society and in the writing of history?
- How are Enlightenment historians doing things differently than before? How did the aims of historians and their histories change?
"%}



## Week 3 (Feb 1--5): The rise of modern history
This week we continue our historiographical survey.


### Monday
- [Week 2 Overview video](https://youtu.be/isu3ia2G0r0). This one is good for making sure you haven't missed key historiographical points that we'll need later, and some advice about doing well on the quizzes.
- [Week 3 Overview video](https://youtu.be/FKo0RlWskqs). This one is good for situating the two chapters in the contours of the course and for highlighting some important ideas you'll need for your Wednesday reflection.

{% include alert.html class='warning' title='Lecture quiz' text="
Originally we had a lecture quiz scheduled for today, but that is CANCELED! Nothing due today. However, the lecture video will help you score higher on the Wednesday reflection.
"%}


### Wednesday
- Popkin, Chapter 4: Rise of Academic Scholarship and Nationalist History, 71--100.

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Reading reflection' text="
A few broad questions to (paradoxically) answer in your reflection:
- How did history become 'professionalized' and more 'scientific' in the 19th century (which we more or less know as 'academic' history today?)
- How would you describe the relationship between history and nationalism as formulated in the 19th century?
"%}


### Friday
- Popkin, Chapter 5: Scientific History in an Era of Conflict, 101--129.

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Reading Quiz' text="
Your quiz will cover the whole chapter as usual, but will focus on one particular question: Why was there a tension between 'scientific' history and global conflicts happening in the early 20th century?
"%}




## Week 4 (Feb 8--12)
We finish up our historiographical survey this week. This week's chapters cover how approaches to history changed in the second half of the 20th century. We are taking a short break from reading responses in favor of READING SUMMARIES. They are described below.


### Monday
{% include alert.html class='warning' title='Nothing due today' text="
No video, no quiz, nada. Nothing due for today! Use the time to produce better reading summaries due this week.
"%}


### Wednesday
- Popkin, Chapter 6: From Objectivity to the "Culture Wars", 133--148.
- Maza, _Thinking about History_, 178--185 (until the new section starts).

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Reading Summary' text="
Using both readings, make a bullet point list of what you consider the most important historical changes described in the chapter. These should be in your own words---don't just copy sentences out of the book---and you should have ~8--10 bullet points. Bullet points should be COMPLETE sentences, and you can have more than one sentence in a single bullet to make more complex points. Make sure each bullet is a separate topic.
"%}


### Friday
- Popkin, Chapter 6: From Objectivity to the "Culture Wars", 148--170.

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Reading Summary' text="
Same thing as Wednesday (but for today's assignment, obviously).
"%}




## Week 5 (Feb 15--19)
Our next book (though we briefly dabbled in it already) introduces and explains some critical questions that we should always be asking about every history we encounter. It sort of picks up where Popkin leaves off (with some helpful overlap), and largely focuses on contemporary history writing and what's new about it as opposed to past traditions. We will apply these questions (and historical examples) to analyzing our final book for the course towards the end of the term.



### Monday
- Popkin Review and Maza Preview Lecture (video link TBP)

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Review Lecture Quiz' text="
- Review/Preview Lecture Quiz (via Learn as always)
"%}


### Wednesday
- Maza, _Thinking about History_, Ch. 1: The History of Whom?, 10--44.

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Reading Reflection' text="
TBA
"%}


### Friday
- Maza, _Thinking about History_, Ch. 2: The History of Where?, 45--82.

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Reading Reflection' text="
TBA
"%}




## Week 6 (Feb 22--26)
Now that our historiographical survey is complete and we've started to think about critical historical questions, we can reflect more thoughtfully on our own historiographical moment. How should we conceptualize and write about U.S. History?

There are NO DAILY ASSIGNMENTS for this week, just one longer reflection essay due on Friday that should demonstrate your familiarity with everything listed below. I have recommended doing work on certain days to space everything out, but you can decide what works for your schedule, since you just have the one essay due Friday.


### Monday
- Browse quickly the [full issue of the _New York Times Magazine_ 1619 Project](https://pulitzercenter.org/sites/default/files/full_issue_of_the_1619_project.pdf) (Aug 26, 2019). The goal here is to get a sense of entire publication---namely what it covers, what it doesn't, and what perspectives the authors promote.

- Nikole Hannah-Jones, [The Idea of America](https://pulitzercenter.org/sites/default/files/the_idea_of_america_full_essay.pdf). An easier-to-read-online version, but without images, is [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20200131161717/https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/08/14/magazine/black-history-american-democracy.html). This statement


### Wednesday
The following two responses to the _NYTM_ issue and its aftermath are online, but sometimes access can be limited. They are in our Zotero library.
- Adam Serwer, "The Fight Over the 1619 Project Is Not About the Facts", _The Atlantic_, December 23, 2019.
- Conor Friedersdorf, "1776 Honors America’s Diversity in a Way 1619 Does Not", _The Atlantic_, January 6, 2020.


### Friday
After browsing the full issue, reading Hannah-Jones's introduction, and reading through the two different perspectives on how we should view the project: How would you characterize the pros and cons of what the project is trying to do?

WARNING: Make specific use of ALL READINGS to inform your response. Don't just rant for or against the project or make bland generalizations about how it's great or stupid without engaging with the arguments from the readings. There is no right answer, but there are better and worse ways of making an informed argument, and that's what I'm evaluating you on.

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Project Reflection' text="
How would you characterize the pros (advantages) and cons (disadvantages) of what the project is trying to do? You should try to address equally (and objectively) both sides of the debate in your post, regardless of your own feelings about it.

Your 1619 Project reflection should be around 800--1000 words and is worth up to 20 points (not counting extra credit, as usual).
"%}

## Week 10 (Mar 22--26):  Monuments and Architecture

{% include alert.html class='warning' title='Reading reflection' text="
There are no daily assignments for this week, just one reflection essay due on Friday--be sure to address BOTH readings.
"%}

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Architecture and Monuments' text="

"%}






## Week 11: Mar 29--Apr 2
We're reading this book to critique its use of history, not because it's "right" (you can decide for yourself how much you agree or disagree with it). The book's goal is to offer a critique of capitalism, but that's beside the point for us. OUR goal is to apply the Maza book on how we should approach history to this specific text, which has a very particular way of using history. Thinking through how history is used here will help us be more informed and critical readers when we see history invoked in any context.

For each week, you'll have about 3 chapters to read. The number of pages per week seems high but the book is a quick read and we're not reading it to learn specific information.

To keep on track, you'll submit a reading reflection on the assigned pages at the end of each week, and that will be the only thing to turn in for the week. I will offer a few guiding questions for you to respond to, but you should feel free to address whatever aspects of the chapters are most interesting to you---provided that you're making it clear to me that you're keeping up with the readings.
