# Schedule of Readings & Assignments

Everything you need to turn in is listed in a red box. Many weeks have short reading reflections due on specified days to keep everyone moving along together and space out the work. But I am also aware that stuff happens and takes up valuable time unexpectedly. As long as you are USUALLY meeting the deadlines, you can submit work up to TWO DAYS after the due date for full credit if the need arises. But this leeway should be used only as a last resort to deal with unusual circumstances.


## Week 1: Jan 18--22

### Syllabus, Expectations, Tools

### Monday
- Welcome lecture and lecture/syllabus quiz
- Introduction to [Zotero](http://zotero.org)

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Do this ASAP' text="
Before you start doing any reading or assignments for the course, follow the [Zotero setup instructions](http://fredgibbs.net/courses/etc/zotero), and make sure you can access the required course readings there. We use this library throughout the semester---and occasionally I add stuff to this during the semester that we'll use for an assignment---so don't be foolish enough to think you can get by without it (although you can if you don't care about your grade).

### Understanding History and its uses
- Alice Dreger, [What is History?](http://alicedreger.com/what_is_history).
The significance of the anecdote offered at the beginning of this piece is not explicitly stated, although it should be. The point here is that every time we ask WHY? about anything, we can focus on immediate practical implications (physics), or much larger structural, historical explanations. They are both important precisely because they provide different kinds of answers. Those who can move fluidly between these ways of understanding will be more astute problem solvers.

- Peter Sterns, [Why Study History](https://www.historians.org/about-aha-and-membership/aha-history-and-archives/historical-archives/why-study-history-(1998\)).

- Popkin, Chapter 1: What is Historiography?, 15--25.
This chapter outlines some interesting reasons for studying history and briefly explains different _kinds_ of history. The books makes a well-intentioned effort to not be exclusively Western, but it really is, and so the few brief non-Western sections here seem a bit forced. Don't skip them, but don't worry about the details.

Drawing from the set of readings for this introductory week: What reasons for studying history have appealed to you (even if you didn't think explicitly about them until now)?

## Week 2: Jan 25--29

### Monday
No new readings for today, but you might start reading the Popkin chapters for this week.

{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Introductory Connections' text="
We're going to make a thread of relatively short introductory posts that answer two questions: what have been your MOST interesting AND LEAST interesting experiences with history---AND WHY? It might be a particular class you've taken, one set of readings for a class, some engaging lectures, a book you couldn't put down, a terrible movie, a history podcast, a trip to a historical place, whatever. Just make sure it describes your experience with history in some way.

GIMICK ALERT: To make everything a bit more connected and fun to read through, I'm going to start a thread on the Learn Discussion Board, and everyone is going to reply to the person who posted immediately before them. You don't need to respond directly or in depth to what the person says, but try your best to connect your post to the last one you can see in the thread. The post you will respond to will probably mention a historical topic or period that you're familiar with (or really dislike), or have been meaning to learn more about, and you can use that as your connection. You and your connection might like totally different topics for the same reason or the same topic for very different reasons. If the post is super short and vague (I love everything about history!), you can still find a way to respond (like, I definitely don't like everything about history because I'm not at all interested in history of great battles. Instead I prefer ...). You get the idea. 3 possible points. 
"%}

### Wednesday
- Popkin, Chapter 2: History in Ancient and Medieval Times, 26--48.

### Friday

## Week 4 (Feb 8--12): 1619 Project discussion
There are no daily assignments for this week, just one reflection essay due on Friday on everything listed below.

- Browse quickly the [full issue of the _New York Times Magazine_ 1619 Project](https://pulitzercenter.org/sites/default/files/full_issue_of_the_1619_project.pdf) (Aug 26, 2019). The goal here is to get a sense of entire publication---namely what it covers, what it doesn't, and what perspectives the authors promote.

- Nikole Hannah-Jones, [The Idea of America](https://pulitzercenter.org/sites/default/files/the_idea_of_america_full_essay.pdf). An easier-to-read-online version, but without images, is [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20200131161717/https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/08/14/magazine/black-history-american-democracy.html). This statement

The following two responses to the _NYTM_ issue and its aftermath are online, but sometimes access can be limited. They are in our Zotero library.
- Adam Serwer, "The Fight Over the 1619 Project Is Not About the Facts", _The Atlantic_, December 23, 2019.
- Conor Friedersdorf, "1776 Honors America’s Diversity in a Way 1619 Does Not", _The Atlantic_, January 6, 2020.

### Friday
{% include alert.html class='danger' title='Project Reflection' text="
After browsing the full issue, reading Hannah-Jones's introduction, and reading through the two different perspectives on how we should view the project, How would you summarize the pros and cons of what the project is trying to do?

WARNING: Make specific use of the readings to inform your response. Don't just rant for or against the project or make bland generalizations about how it's great or stupid without engaging with the arguments from the readings. There is no right answer, but there are better and worse ways of making an argument, and that's what I'm looking for.

## Week 12: Apr 5--9
Remember, we're reading this book to critique its use of history, not because it's "right" (you can decide for yourself how much you agree or disagree with it). The book's goal is to offer a critique of capitalism, but that's beside the point for us. OUR goal is to apply our discussion about what history is for to this point to this specific text that has a very particular way of using history. Critically thinking through how history is used here will help us be more informed readers when we see history invoked in any context.

For each week, you'll have a couple chapters to read and will submit a reading reflection on the assigned pages. I will offer a few guiding questions for you to respond to, but you should feel free to address whatever aspects of the chapters are most interesting to you provided that you're making it clear to me that you're keeping up with the readings.
