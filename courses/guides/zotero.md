## Connecting to Zotero
- Go to [zotero.org](http://zotero.org) and create a free account with a username and password. I recommend using your UNM email address.
- Once you've created an account and logged in, click on the link on your class syllabus for the class Zotero library. There should be a red "Join" button that you can click to request access to the shared library for course readings.
- I approve requests every few hours. Follow directions on your course syllabus to see if you can access PDFs for the course. What does that mean? Read on...


## Using Zotero
You can know if you have access to the readings if you can bring up a PDF of any readings listed in the library. If you can't, the TROUBLESHOOTING section below should help.

The main thing to know is that double-clicking a reading will bring up the PDF attached to it.

HOWEVER, a few items in our Zotero library have more than one PDF attached to them. In those cases, double-clicking brings up the same item repeatedly. If you're getting the wrong chapter when double-clicking at item, single-click on the item to select it, then click the "Attachments" tab near the upper right of the page. You'll see links to all PDFs for that item and you can select the PDF you need and click the icon to open it. The title of the PDF should make it clear what it is.



## TROUBLESHOOTING & FAQs

### I can see the items on the group library page, but I can't find/open any PDFs.
- Everyone can SEE items in the library, even when not logged into zotero.org. You can only access the PDFs if you have JOINED the library and are logged in.
  - First, check that you're logged in to zotero.org.
  - If you ARE logged in, but can't get any PDFs to open, then you haven't joined the group library. Follow the directions on the homepage of the syllabus.

### I keep getting the wrong PDF when I double-click a reading in the library.

### I'm logged into zotero.org, but I can't find the group library for the course.
- Click on the "groups" tab or link at the top of the page and you should see a link to the group homepage for the course.
- If you don't see a link to the course library on the main part of the page then either you aren't logged into zotero.org or you haven't yet joined our group.
- The easiest way to get to the group library, and make sure you're going to the right spot, is to use the link on the home page of the syllabus.


## HIGHLY RECOMMENDED: Install Zotero on your computer
Using the Zotero website to access the readings will always work, but it's rather clunky. I HIGHLY recommend that you [download and install Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/download/) on your computer, so you'll have a much faster, convenient, and clearer interface to the readings that will always be available on your computer. Use the "Standalone" version, as it's called. It is a small app that is entirely safe to install.

While in the process of installing the Zotero app, you'll have the option to link the Zotero app to your online zotero.org account. Be sure to do this! If you complete the installation and have not told your Zotero app about your zotero.org account, go into the Zotero preferences menu (however you get to application preferences menus on your platform), and select the "Sync" tab. You can enter your username and password there.

Once you have connected the Zotero app to your zotero.org account, you will see on the leftmost column of your Zotero display, near the bottom, a “Group Libraries” header, and you'll see a  folder with the name of our group library for the course; click on that to see all the readings for the semester.

Double clicking an item opens a PDF, just like on zotero.org.

**If an item has multiple PDFs associated with it** (like two book chapter scans), you'll need to click on the arrow to the left of that item to see all the associated PDFs for that item. Then you can double click the one you want to open. Just double clicking the item opens whichever PDF comes first alphabetically (which normally works since there is normally just one PDF per item).

If you've only recently joined the group library, Zotero will take a few minutes to download all the PDFs, but eventually you'll have all of them on your computer. If I update the Zotero library with a new reading (or a better scan or something like that), you'll automatically get it.


## Stay organized
Especially if you ever have bibliographic research to do, Zotero is incredibly helpful in keeping your sources organized and creating bibliographies for you. Learning how to stay organized in your work (whether school or other professional endeavor) is a crucial skill that you'll want to develop sooner than later because it will save you tremendous amounts of time. You'll make more money, be happier, etc. This course is a great excuse to start experimenting with finding a process that works best for you. Your future self will thank you!
