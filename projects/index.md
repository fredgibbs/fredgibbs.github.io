# Stuff I'm Working On

## The Unnatural History of Natural Food
This project maps out the shifting contours of the idea of “natural food” in the United States beginning around the early nineteenth-century as religious and health reformers responded to the emergence of new convenience and packaged foods. Perhaps because the term “natural” has become so ubiquitous, its long, complex, and enlightening history has been overlooked, yet it provides a revealing lens onto popular relationships between nature, technology, and modernity. Even amidst massive cultural change over the last century, the way appeals to natural food have been formulated, contested, and appropriated provides much needed perspective on contemporary (but often ahistorical and reductive) debates about the meaning and implications of natural food, its place in our food system, and ways it continues to shape food production and consumption.


## Public Digital History Infrastructure
For reasons unknown, I’ve started in my classes to do more digital public history projects rather than standard essays and other assignments. I like building things and working with students to do that rather than just submitting work for grades. Students indicate that they enjoy it, work harder, and learn more. Each class makes new contributions, and over time that work adds up to digital history projects that would be nearly impossible to do otherwise.

While there seems to be a rapidly increasing number of student-driven digital history projects (and not only in digital history courses). But there also seems to be a fair amount of reinventing the wheel within each project. Some is necessary for many reasons, but it also seems useful to have a more centralized place for explaining a strategy for planning and executing these kinds of projects, both from technical and logistical standpoints.

With an emphasis on simplicity, sustainability, and thorough documentation, this project seeks to develop and maintain a jumping off point for public digital history projects with GitHub and GitHub Pages. You can check out the [latest version of Jekylton](https://github.com/fredgibbs/jekylton) in my repository and use it as a template for a new project.

[A brief set of slides](http://fredgibbs.net/presentations/ghi/) provides more detail.


## Digital Heritage Studies
Over the last year (with my colleague Taylor Spence) I have been working to formalize a new undergraduate minor and graduate certificate in Digital Heritage Studies at UNM. This program capitalizes on UNM’s position at the crossroads of both regional and international cultures, and offers undergraduates and graduates the opportunity to create a powerful synergy between their chosen major or research interests, the cultural diversity of the Southwest, core tenets of the humanities, and public digital humanities.

To promote digital research and publishing skills more broadly, faculty and students will collectively maintain a Digital Heritage Lab, which will offer training for students in the conception, implementation, and maintenance of regional digital humanities projects, as well as integrate the certificate program to cultural heritage partners around the region.

The DHS grew out of a [Spatial Humanities Working Group](http://spatialhumanities.unm.edu), which helped build connections across disciplinary boundaries by providing an informal setting in which students and faculty across the university can meet to discuss theoretical, conceptual, and methodological questions regarding space and human societies.


## Digital Historic Trails
Working with the National Trails - Intermountain Region (NTIR) Office, and then-graduate student Guy McClellan, I organized an multidisciplinary [research practicum course](http://fredgibbs.net/courses/trails/) that provides an introduction to the study, interpretation, and significance of the National Historic Trails System, as well as engages students as core contributors to ongoing research projects at the NTIR office. As preparation for research projects, students read about trail historiography, overland migration, gender dynamics on the trail, interactions with native communities, international commerce, and borderlands. The strong public history facet of the course encourages students to grapple with key questions about historic trails and national memory: How does a historic trail retain cultural significance? What are the challenges and strategies in communicating about the trails to a 21st-century audience?
