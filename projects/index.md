# Ongoing Projects

## Unnaturally natural diets
This project maps out the contours of the idea of "natural" diets in the long history of Western medical tradition, with an emphasis on the last few centuries of industrialized food. Perhaps because the ideas of natural foods and diets have become so ubiquitous, their long and complex history has been overlooked. Yet the way definitions and debates about our natural diet have shifted over time provides a revealing lens onto popular relationships between nature, technology, and modernity. 


## History with AI
AI is here and is not going away. From a teaching standpoint, higher education (at least) must train students to use it ethicially and skillfully. How can humanities courses take advantage of AI to _strengthen_ critical thinking?

From a research standpoint, AI is challenging conventional notions of expertise. What are the implications for the "expert" historian? How can historians employ AI for menial tasks and free time and energy for more creative thinking? How can AI be leveraged for its broad (if shallow) knowledge that could open new avenues for research?


## Amaranth
In the summer of 2025, PhD student Jonathan Seyfried and I launched [Amaranth, UNM's Digital Humanities and Public Scholarship Studio](https://amaranth-unm.github.io/). We strive to harness innovative digital technologies to facilitate engagement with the humanities. We empower scholars, educators, and communities to create immersive, interactive archives and storytelling experiences that invite critical engagement with core humanities issues. Through collaborative projects, open-access resources, and sustainable digital platforms, we bridge academic research with public discourse.



## Digital Pedagogy via Xanthan
Discourse in Public Digital History has often called for more open source tools that facilitate digital pedagogy, literacy, and sustinable project work, faculty and students have had few options between ad-saturated versions of web hosting software or proprietary tools like StoryMaps. 

With an emphasis on simplicity, sustainability, and thorough documentation, [Xanthan](https://amaranth-unm.github.io/xanthan/) provides an accessible jumping off point for public digital history projects with GitHub Pages, which provides ample instructions for anyone to create their own website with free, simple, and mostly code-free text files.

[A brief set of slides](http://fredgibbs.net/presentations/ghi/) provides a brief overview.



## Xanthan-based examples
Below are links to a few sample projects built with Xanthan. Students constructed every single page in these sites, and learned how to collaboratively build a website with plain text files and GitHub Pages, all brought together by Xanthan.


### UNM Campus Histories
As an example of using Xanthan to organize an ongoing course project, check our [UNM Campus History website](http://amaranth-unm.github.io/campus-history/). Students in three iterations of a digital history course (of one kind or another) have contributed to this project by 


### Intro to Historiography
This project showcases the collaborative essays produced by an advanced undergraduate historiography course at the University of New Mexico. The essays collected here take both a chronological and thematic approach to highlighting important continuities and and ruptures in the way people have conceived and produced historical interpretations of the western world. Our collectively written and edited [Intro Guide to Historiography](https://unm-historiography.github.io/metahistory/), assembled over many semesters, provides an accessible and welcoming guide for undergraduates _by_ undergraduates to understand how historical research and writing has changed over time. 


### National Historic Trails
Working with the National Historic Trails Intermountain Region (NTIR) Office, UNM history graduate student Guy McClellan and I organized an multidisciplinary research practicum course (the syllabus is [archived here](http://fredgibbs.net/courses/archive/ trails/)) that provided an introduction to the study, interpretation, and significance of the National Historic Trails System, as well as engaged students as core contributors to ongoing research projects at the NTIR office. As preparation for research projects, students read about trail historiography, overland migration, gender dynamics on the trail, interactions with native communities, international commerce, and borderlands. The strong public history facet of the course encouraged students to grapple with key questions about historic trails and national memory: How does a historic trail retain cultural significance? What are the challenges and strategies in communicating about the trails to a 21st-century audience? 

Our work came to life on a [website on the National Historic Sites on the Santa Fe Trail](https://historic-trails.unm.edu/).


### Histories of the Future
This project was an experiment to see if a small academic workshop (on speculative futures in the history of science) could produce and make available a collection of scholarly work in an open access web format that would remain more visible an active than the results (and papers) from a typical academic workshop. This is a great example of how Xanthan can preserve and make the work a one-off workshop openly visible and available for specialists and non-specialists alike. Our work lives on at [histscifi.com](http://histscifi.com).
