## Early Design + Code Work
More technical details about these projects can be found on [my CV](/cv).

### UW Center for the Humanities
As the web developer and designer for the UW Center for the Humanities, I worked closely with the directors and staff to help redefine and modernize their web presence, as well as to identify ways of using the website to carry out the Center’s core mission. This has entailed establishing and documenting best practices for how to better integrate content creation and deployment with the Center’s workflow.

### UW Student Academic Affairs
I architected, designed, coded, and implemented a robust content management system for a conglomeration of about twenty separate programs under the SAA administrative umbrella. I embarked on a three-year plan to gradually implement new features while managing productive relationships with each of the constituents.

### USDA Farm Energy Self Assessment
As the lead designer and programmer, I focused on designing the clearest possible user interfaces to help farmers reduce energy costs. On a larger scale, I also served as a project manager, developing milestone driven timelines, as well as to establish more efficient processes for content review and testing efforts among the core team.

### Freelance Web Design
I've been fortunate to work with over a dozen different organizations and research scholars to create websites that best reflect their individual personalities and goals. The cumulative experience remains highly influential on my sense of design, interaction, usability, and how scholars most comfortable with text tend to think in terms technological familiarity rather than innovative possibilities.
