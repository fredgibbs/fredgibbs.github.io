# Presentations
This is a place where I experiment with different digital presentation formats.

It's also a convenient place to publish a written version of conference presentations that I think should have a more permanent home. Also, I'm a hoarder. So this is basically the digital equivalent of a closet full of stuff one can't bear to let go.
