Let's assume everyone uses Zotero. That's not true, but it should be. Regardless, supplying your users with proper metadata is a good idea.

After many years of gross negligence, I recently set out to make my own website more friendly to Zotero. I'm not really a technical person. My approach to solving technical problems---like getting Zotero to recognize my blog posts as blog posts---is to Google it, find a concrete example and then try, with determination and whiskey, to adapt it to my situation.

In this case, it was a bit more cryptic to work out than I expected, which is a shame because everyone's ideas that might become part of a documented discourse (translation: put in someone's Zotero library) should be able to do this.
