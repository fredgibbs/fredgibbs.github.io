The conference program for the [48th International Congress on Medieval Studies](http://www.wmich.edu/medieval/congress/index.html) provides vivid testimony to the vibrant work in both medieval medicine and digital history. I've taken a quite liberal definition of "medical" here, including talks that deal with imagery of the body (like flaying, for example). With far more sessions than time slots, it's inevitable that several must overlap, though still no less disappointing. But hopefully there will be even more next year.
