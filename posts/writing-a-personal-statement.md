# Unsolicited Personal Statement Advice

Hello Student who has asked for a letter of recommendation!

With the luxury of teaching smaller undergraduate seminars on a regular basis, writing letters of recommendations for students is a regular part of my fall semester. As you probably know, I always request that I see a copy of applicants' personal statements so that I can write a letter that complements what the student has written about themselves---highlighting strengths, mitigating weaknesses, and generally waxing poetic about the student from an instructor's standpoint.

Every student is different, and I don't pretend to have any special knowledge or magical formula. But I've noticed that I've written out many variations on the more or less the email too many times to count (rhetorically, not technically, speaking), so I thought I would synthesize the usual comments into a short reference piece here that can be more careful and thorough than in possible in each individual email.

These are only my opinions and don't reflect any masterly advice on personal statement writing. Obviously these are YOUR statements and need to reflect your own values, priorities, and personality.  

## Be unique
It's useful to say more about your unique personal strengths or characteristics that set you apart from other applicants. Similarly, any elaboration and detail on WHY you are interested/passionate/dedicated/ to your field of interest will help the admissions committee understand why investing in you is such a good idea. Many truly outstanding students who stand out in my memory comes across as entirely pedestrian on paper.

## This is not a time for humility


## Saying you'll work hard is not convincing
I write a lot of letters for law school applicants, and the most common corrective advice I give is to pull back from repeating: "I really want to study law and I’m going to work really hard at it!" Instead, the more you can say about WHY you like law, or what eventually motivated you to take your academic talents in that direction, or the difference you want to make via your law career, or how you are uniquely suited to make certain kinds of contributions given your background--those personal details really bring out your own personality more effectively than generic statements. They also make a case for why they should pick YOU versus other applicants. Provide evidence or examples of your intellectual curiosity and ability to succeed at studying law. That would go a long way in showing readers, rather than simply telling them, how you’re going to be a success, which of course you will.

## Go beyond your transcript
Too many personal statements are really just explanation of what you’re up to and what you’ve done--basically a prose version of your transcript. Personal statements are the best/only places to highlight your talents that aren’t otherwise apparent—-and to showcase the energy and intellectual depth that will set you apart from most other applicants. What really intrigues you about what you want to do? Even if you can’t be very specific right now, what can you really bring to this program and your future career that others can’t?

## Don't dwell on past indiscretions
If your personal statement needs to address some deficiencies in your transcript, that’s fine and very important to do. It's not uncommon to be focused on things outside of academia until you finding an academic groove of sorts. But don't take a lot of space to make that relatively straightforward point.


## Get personal
I can see academic success or struggles via transcripts, which I can easily read as effort, ability to overcome adversity, ambition, etc. What I can’t see is WHY that person is doing what they do, or HOW that person thinks about the world and their place in it. Personal statements are super helpful in answering those questions. The admissions people want to learn about YOU, personally. They are also, I think, considering what kind of colleague you will be, and what kind of citizen you will be once you leave the law school and represent them in your professional work.

## Get fit
When I read personal statements, I’m trying to understand the fit between the person, department, and institution.
