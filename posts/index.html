<h1>Posts</h1>

<p>Here's where I post stuff that I think is interesting and useful enough to share, but doesn't necessarily fit in a more formal publication. Several of these posts have made their way into official publications of one kind or another; for those I tend to remove the trial version from here to reduce clutter.</p>

<p>It's a personal archive of sorts, but it doesn't pretend to be comprehensive. I routinely filter out older posts when they seem to have lost their utility, or if I don't like them anymore.</p>

<p>It's also a convenient place to publish a written version of conference presentations that I think should have a more permanent home.</p>
