## Ongoing Projects  

### Spatial Humanities Working Group (Aug2015 - present)
This working group aims to build connections across disciplinary boundaries by providing an informal setting in which students and faculty across the university can meet to discuss theoretical, conceptual, and methodological questions regarding space and human societies. See more at the [SHWG website](http://spatialhumanities.unm.edu).


### General Editor, _Programming Historian_ (Apr2012 - present)
_[Programming Historian](http://programminghistorian.org)_ offers novice-friendly, peer-reviewed tutorials that help humanists learn a wide range of digital tools, techniques, and workflows to facilitate their research. I have been a general editor since 2012; I have guided over a half-dozen lessons from proposals to polished tutorials, as well as helped develop and document a transparent and sustainable editorial process anchored with free, open source tools.
